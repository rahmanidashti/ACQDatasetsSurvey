What a rudely chip-on-the-shoulder question! It sounds like you just took overrighteous umbrage to mask you own educational embarrassment when later in life you found that your childhood playmates spoke (or do you prefer ‘speaked’?) a non-standard dialectal variant, and have come here in hopes of trying to justify your own misunderstandings. If you expect the perfect regularity of some 2½-year-old’s limited apprehension, then go design your own bloody language. Once you has maked that cake, you’d goodest be ready to eat it.

@Seamus My point is that when it bugs you that people get it "wrong", they aren't getting it "wrong" in these cases.  Your annoyance implies that you don't like the ones that don't fall into place — why else would you be bugged by it?  These places where people are "wrong" are the usages that just don't fit this arbitrarily overreaching rule.
If you only meant to say it sounds wrong *to you*, why didn't you give specific examples in your question?  It definitely sounds like you are taking for granted that these are universally regarded as errors.  The way that *much/many* works just doesn't precisely correspond to *less/fewer* and *amount/number*.  People aren't miscalculating whether something is a count noun or not, they just aren't applying such a neat rule as you are describing.  Some discussion here: http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003775.html
With standard punctuation this could get confusing--in what way? It seems perfectly clear.
Some abbreviations may legitimately end a sentence.  "I like the Carl's Jr. Double Western Bacon Cheesebergers rock."  Is the appreciation for a commemorative stone depicting a sandwich, or for a particular restaurant facility and a sandwich that it serves?  I would think the same argument that HTML tags should be based upon semantics rather than default appearance would be equally applicable to sentence spacing: whether or not they will render differently, an abbreviation which does not end a sentence is semantically different from one which does, and should thus be represented differently.
Would you? Could you? / in a car? / Eat them! Eat them! / Here they are.

Hyperbole, perhaps? Not exactly what you mean, but close I think.
Why do the words contradict each other?
Delegator is a word, but I suspect that it is exceedingly obscure legal jargon. I'm sorry, I really cannot think of a solution. I should think that it is usually not necessary to list the people in a company that have delegates, since having a delegate is not really a task or a job, so that is perhaps why there is no word. But that doesn't help you. May I ask what you need it for? With more context we have a wider scope to search for solutions.

Very interesting questions you raise. But I can think of several reasons why this question will probably be closed: it is not clear what is being asked (I see several questions that deserve separate answers); the question will lead to discussion rather than discrete answers (is RP still important or not?); off topic (when I asked, I was once told that questions on mostly socio-linguistic issues were off topic, which I still deplore). I'd still be very much interested in what people have to say about this.

The point is that is very very unlikely that anybody will ever find this question by searching for it (what would you look for). You could write: "What words would you use to describe something that does not at all reach the expectations you have for it?" You can then, if you wish, add the example of the park, maybe add another one or two examples. The question will be essentially the same, but it will be more wide and easier to look for.

I wonder if it is really that different. After all, the **name** is that by which something or someone is **called**, and the two phrases have the same meaning.

Also, from etymology of [call][1] we have a meaning "to give a name to" is (from) mid-13c in English. The word name, comes from Old English nama. Meaning "one's reputation" is from c.1300.

Just to be clear, do you want a word for independent invention that chronologically followed the other inventor's discovery, as opposed to simply a word for independent invention, per jsbangs's answer?
OK, Terry, but there are two meanings of the word "original" at work here: "Preceding all others in time", and "Not derived from something else". An independent invention is original in the second sense, but not in the first. My question was, are you looking for a single word that unambiguously means original in both senses (precedence in time, AND not derived)? Or vice versa, something that is does NOT have precedence in time, though not derived from the preceding discovery)? That seems to be the question, but that does not make it "less" original, just original in fewer senses of the word.

From time to time there are "simplified spelling" movements in English.  But so far they have not done much.  Noah Webster did some.  Things like "thru" and "altho" in the 1960s.  Since pronunciation of English differs from place to place, do we want the spelling to differ along with it?
What comes after '--we were both clunks'? Does it expand on the odd epithet any further?
How do you know it’s *-able* and not *-ible*? The OED attests more than 400 *-ible* words.  And no, I’m not counting *Bible* and such. *force > forcible, fuse > fusible, immerse > immersible, reduce > reducible*.  There are lots and lots of those.

Yes, the sentence is grammatical (you can combine sentences with conjunctions to make new sentences ad infinitum). It might be difficult to understand and stylistically disfavored, but it syntactically follows the rules of English (can you do it grammatically in your native language?).

Why did you have a pleonasm in the title? In English it sounds bad. Do you do that in titles in German?
Your title uses multiple words redundantly. In fact it is a phrase commonly used in jokes about needlessly repetitive usage (you use it in your text so it seems you're not trying to make a joke). But if your title had been the less comedic 'How to avoid __needless__ repetition?', I think it would be obvious that the answer would be 'Don't do it then'.

Most of those came via French and two came from Norse. "Instead" wasn't borrowed directly but was invented to translate Latin "in loco".

Indeed, something along those lines _would_ have sufficed; it would have made your question more interesting, useful, and relevent.

Perhaps you should say it's 'perfectly acceptable' in _your_ programming circles.

I don't think that "colorizable" is going to confuse your audience. If need be, you could consider hyphenating it as "colorize-able". I suspect that "paintable" suffers from the same issues as "tintable". That said, why are you not calling them "Greyscale images"?
A few dictionaries do have a second definition of colorable to mean what you want it to mean, like [this one](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/colorable?r=66), and one of the sources cited [here](http://www.wordnik.com/words/colorable). Interesting what else that word can mean, though.

You should explain that when you ask; that way, people are far less likely to pounce, deride, inquire, scorn, and rebuke. Had you started with the Vonnegut quote, explained what you knew, added a few words from a dictionary, then asked your question by saying something like: "This quote has me wondering, are there any differences between these words? Are there times when I might use one over the other to describe a certain kind of dance?" I think there's a good chance you would've had less downvotes, and maybe even upvotes.

Also "So I had to" is telling little. Were you told to get off or thrown off, or did you surmise that it's best to get off?
I certainly didn't mean to offend you, so I'm sorry for that. But you must realise that I'm addressing an unknown number of people as I write, not you in particular. Obviously this specific comment is directed at *you*, so I'm using that pronoun. But if a dozen people are reading the earlier comment, and you are only one of them, *"OP"* seems by convention to be the best way of referring to you. Regarding your second point - why would you not be happy to use the same phrases native speakers use? It just makes no sense.

Justices are supposed to be above or apart from that, so there could be other contexts where someone insists that judges are _not_ part of the government, and that might be a valid way of looking at it, too.

Don't you mean people who have not finished their work _before_ the deadline?  These would be the people who do finish _after_, or who never finish.  Your phrasing seems to be logically similar to a double negative.
I'm finding this question a bit [Pinteresque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristics_of_Harold_Pinter's_work). Are we seriously expected to understand *"The HSL is gathering way"*? I've never heard of HSL, and I don't know what *"to gather way"* means. Would it make any difference to my understanding of the rest of the question if I did? Sorry, but I think this is Not Constructive. There's no "grammar" involved here - just vague non-committal language being used to delay explicitly stating a position.
Re: "Does any 'modern' grammar afford better terms and concepts?": [Discourse Representation Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_representation_theory) might, if we view the first instance of each of those phrases as introducing a new discourse referent available as a starting-point for subsequent comparisons.
I've frequently encountered *big brother* used in the context you mention. But you are necessarily looking for a single word? Does *potentate* cut the mustard?
STRUT and FOOT have nothing like the same vowel for me, so I am confused.  STRUT like CUT and SHUT has /ʌ/ while FOOT and PUT like ROOT and ROOF have /ʊ/. Which of those two do you have for both STRUT and FOOT, or do you have something else again? Yes, Californians, especially from the south, do have a bunch of odd mergers.
What about CULT?  Is that FOOT or STRUT, or something else?
I'm voting to close this as Not Constructive. But I won't vote to delete if the chance comes up, because I want to cite this as the "original" when I vote to close every future "Who decides what's valid English?" question as a duplicate.
I find that the use of _sales_ is ambiguous here. Are you talking about individual items sold or total sales of many items? IOW, I might expect three sales to make more than $470 (each) or I might expect three to earn me more than $470 in toto.
What does the dictionary tell you? Also, note that the MSN article clearly places _unwatering_ within quotes.

Is it lack of trust of the degree itself, or lack of trust about the institution? 'Accredited' is what is used for a university or program. For the degree itself, that's sort of a strange thing to doubt the degree.
So is this a meta-concept? How people deal with racism in others, how much they care about it?
It's not clear what concept you're looking for. Also a single word may not capture it. Can you give a succinct accurate label using 5 words or less? 'Race awareness difference'? 'Social race involvement'? Something like that?
First thought: It's a bit mean, calling someone a door. Though I guess it could be considered foreplay?
Is English not your girlfriend's native language by any chance? Some European languages prefer this form over the other, for instance in French you usually say "I'll open you the door" ("Je t'ouvrirai/vais t'ouvrir la porte") this might explain it. Being natively french, I sometimes do similar subtle mistakes.
So, are we talking about a six-foot man with the mind of a five-year old or not? If we *are*, in what sense is he not "retarded/mentally challenged"? If we're *not*, exactly how much of a size/brainpower mismatch are we talking about here? I am asking in all seriousness, but I think the question is inevitably going to be Not Constructive.
I'm not clear exactly why you're asking this. Do you dispute the Wiktionary entry, which clearly indicates that *not all* "camp followers" are prostitutes? OED defines the term as *A man or woman who follows or hangs on to a camp or army, without being in military service.* It doesn't even *mention* prostitution - which is a common connotation, but by no means the only sense in which the term can be used.
I must be a bit thick today. Where is the "ambiguity"? Take this one from [firstbaptistchurchinamerica.org](http://www.firstbaptistchurchinamerica.org/?p=2078): *He calls us to become co-laborers with Christ, not mere camp followers relying on the cheap grace of easy forgiveness.* I doubt the writer there meant "prostitutes" in the sense you mean. Why would anyone think he might?
Are you sure you mean *individual constituents* instead of *from the level of the individual constituent*? The singular construction is often used to imply the group, and it allows the singular *level* to be used without any ambiguity: no one will be confused whether you are trying to imply that all constituents share a single level.
That would be the [FAQ](http://english.stackexchange.com/faq); I could see where some might regard this as a "chatty, open-ended" question. _Of course_ a dictionary is a better place to learn about suitable antonyms than an Ngram. Your Ngram is interesting, and provides some measure of evidence that _tiny_ & _huge_ could be coupled, much like _small_ & _large_ are, but [that won't always work](http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=love%2Chate&year_start=1800). So, there's not much to say here except, "Hmm, that's interesting," and, "Yes, dictionaries & thesauri are the best resources."
There's also a matter of polling. Considering your question: *I'm wondering whether anyone has looked at* the only direct answers would be "I did", "I didn't", and "I know someone who did".  These are rather of dubious value. A question "Best method to find closest antonyms?" would be much better - with your idea given as your research outside of the common dictionary comparison, and one could expect other good ideas for this.
Umm. What use is a linguistic classification category that has only one member?
You probably need to elaborate on your question. Why is "likely to sweat" not acceptable?
I think this is Not A Real Question. If something is normally sold at £35, and someone offers to sell it for "35 times less", who in their right mind would expect to be given £1190 (£35 - 35 x £35) if they offer to "buy" one? @Anderson - you should expect to pay **£1** there.
By all means suggest some other credible alternative interpretation. Clearly the "literal" one makes no sense at all, so what's your problem with *"1/35th the amount"*?
I know I got away with asking [What exactly is an “adverb”?](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/75491/), but I really think this one is too broad. Apart from anything else, some people would say *adjectives* are just the particular subclass of *adverbs* that modify nouns (adverbs certainly modify more than just verbs). But the short answer is that if a word or phrase modifies/qualifies a (pro)noun *in a specific context*, then *in that context* it's an adjective or adjectival phrase.
So what's your question?
@Frank You need to explain in more detail what your intention is with regard to your sentence. What is the relationship between the questionnaire and the 100 factors?

Tyler: You couldn't find it? What, you didn't know to search for "apartment"? ;^) On a more serious note, I like Hellion's answer there, i.e.: 3- to 5-page essay. (Spelling out three- to five-page works, too, but I still like Hellion's answer – just in case you need to write "35- to 40-page essay" someday.)

Are there previous *Versions?*
If what you meant to say was the second version, why didn't you just say that in the first place? The first version is grammatically gibberish.
If you're truly interested in "grammar", and in knowing whether a given form is "correct" or not, why not start by practising with words like **want to**?
Yes. If you leave it like that someone will probably end up correcting it anyway. But surely you can see that on a site for [linguists, etymologists, and (serious) English language enthusiasts](http://english.stackexchange.com/faq) it's not a particularly appropriate form?

Are you looking for a phrase that expresses sympathy, doesn't incur an "it's not your fault" response, AND doesn't prolong the exchange between you and the other person? If so, that is asking for a powerful expression and a powerful facial expression to deliver it.
If a person is half genius and half idiot, or a job is half work and half play, that doesn’t make those nouns into adjectives. Why would you think it would do that to them?  I wouldn’t exactly call them mass nouns either, but no, you cannot make plurals of them. They are more like categories when used that way.  What exactly is the trouble here?  This is an unremarkable construct.
Don’t be ridiculous.  If someone is *half idiot*, then he is *half an idiot* and *half of an idiot*.  See how that works?  Those are nouns.  Let’s not change the *half* part.

I can't see how this teacher can support this. "She and her sister" is plural, thus "were." I'm aware of no such rule that makes an exception...and what is the definition of the exception? Is the teacher saying that this is a rule for was/were at the beginning of a sentence?

I've not come across _onboarding_ before today. Do you have a link that provides a definition?
Do you need to use lie? Can't you just say there are intermediate targets?
Is this a proper word? Yes, it **is** the proper "word" **if** *enqueue* had already been defined in the document with a specific meaning of an activity/task. Say, the glossary lists *enqueue* . "The algorithm **will *enqueue*** the id associated with the job ... However, the algorithm could *re-enqueue* the id associated with the job ..." Do not forget the hyphen ever, in this particular kind of usage, though. It is possible to use the *re-* *un-* *non-* *de-* / *dis-* prefixes to any known word or neologism, except where the required meaning already has a word.
*Proclaim* is fine, but you might just say *call*. The second part of the sentence, though, also needs work.  Do you mean that you can't call him a cheater because it's just speculation at this point?
btw - if I asked someone where they were from, and they answered *"the western hemisphere"* (in *any* context I can imagine), I'd take that as pretty much on a par with *"None of your business!"* Did you *really* say that?

Since you provide instances in which the term *geisha girl* was in fact used to refer both to “actual geisha” and “women who aren’t actually geisha”, I think you have already answered your ‘actual question’. Is perhaps your underlying question  “Should the term be used in either sense?”
@Vivi A mass noun is always singular. These prefix modifiers cannot change that. If stuff bothers you, that lots of stuff bothers you, too. See how that works? It is ungrammatical to say that lots of stuff *bother you.  You’re agreeing with the wrong thing.

I suggest you would probably get better answers at [Writers.SE](http://writers.stackexchange.com/). Failing that, I suggest that you buy her a copy of *Cyrano de Bergerac*, by the French playwright Edmond Rostand. It may offer her many highly literary ideas; and even if it doesn't it is a very romantic and moving play which will provide her a very good cry. And then she can inscribe the book with an affectionate note and give it to David. — By the way, did you know that *Teifi* is the Welsh spelling of *Davey*?

They're at least far more common  - how many times have you read of a *geologue* or a *neurolog*?!
Only the first has *-agogue*; the others have *-agogy* and *-agogical*, so this does not make sense. I still do not understand what sound `/ä/` is intended to represent.  A centralized `/a/`?

Hi, Petr. As it stands, this question is "general reference", because it's easy to find the answer in a good dictionary. To improve it, you need to give us more details: what specific context were you thinking of using either word? After looking up the words in a dictionary, what are you still not clear about? (It's entirely possible to look things up in a dictionary and end up more confused than you started. Been there, done that.) Also, since you're asking this *because* you're not a native speaker, have you considered asking it on ell.stackexchange.com instead?
Why do you expect a single word? Is this at the tip of your tongue but you can't remember it?  Or do you have a single word for it in your first language (if not English)?
Wait: you’re asking for a ***single word*** to describe the *fear* of getting freaked out by things that are not there?  That seems highly unlikely to be answerable. The [fear of **having** hallucinations](http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic103938.html) is different from being afraid of the hallucinations themselves.

Also, just because you have two nouns in a row does not mean that the first one has become an adjective.

After looking at your other questions, and rereading this one, it is still unclear to me what you want. The ostensible answer is 'There exist transliteration methods (e.g. Hepburn)' and that's enough. But You already know that so you must be asking something else. Are you asking why Japanese make mistakes in using some of these systems? That's because people aren't perfect. Are you asking for general rules that explain these mistakes? Well, that's a tall order requiring a list of mistakes which could be many. Or are you asking something else? What exactly are you asking?

Or something you don't want, like some drugs, when you're about to go through the gates at the airport? Or something questionable, like a sandwich? "Opposite" is a loaded word. The only sure opposite of a pickpocket is someone who respects your property and doesn't go near your pocket. If someone puts incriminating evidence in your pocket, that is called "planting".
Why do you suspect its grammaticality? There are several grammatical/ other errors in the question.
How about a *depleted* token?
So this is a made up word?
What made you think it is a pronoun, of whatever kind? How is the research going so far? Can you share your findings?
What makes "yet I know I can be very wrong"?
It's not the same thing -- your question was "what sounds *more natural*", right?
*Why* a word is or is not used is not really something that can be explained. You might as well ask "Why do Americans use a German term when there are two normal English words for the same thing?"
Hi Lee, is there a reason why you're asking this?  Is there perhaps a deeper problem you're hoping to solve?  If so, I suggest a little more explanation in the body of the post, as it will help understand why you're asking this and also may help others locate this in Google searches.
In what way do you think is *wine* different from *alcohol* in the context? Does *wine* seem unqualified to you to "get to something"?
How long? Two hours long. Three days long. A few weeks long. Some years long. His whole life long. Looks to me like everything else modifies *long*, whether it's deployed as an adverb or as an adjective.
But you can't ask *How ago?* I don't recall ever hearing of a *six-month-ago conference*. You can't nominalize to *an agoth [or would it be 'an agait'?] of three days.* You don't say *He worked so ago*.
Are [these](http://thesaurus.com/browse/chip+in  t) what you’re looking for?
Think about, " I was angry with him for a few years" or "jack is angry with his friend". They suggest continuous phaze of time right?
Sentence two is better.  I would also eliminate the word "as":  Although we were becoming closer and closer, we remained just friends.  Might you be talking about a relationship between a male and a female?  If so, you might be describing a "platonic" relationship, one in which there is no romantic involvement or commitment.  For a humorous perspective on the "platonic" relationship, see the scene in the movie "When Harry Met Sally," in which Harry insists that a man and a woman cannot be just friends!  Funny!
I am amazed that there can be such spirited debate over whether a period can follow an abbreviation and no-one notes that pounds is NOT a unit of weight! Did the OP mean to refer to mass?
Let me get this straight.  In your sentence "I replaced your cola in the fridge with a beer after drinking it," do you mean that you somehow got into the refrigerator, drank a beer, and then replaced the cola with an empty beer can?  No, that can't be right.  I think what you meant to say is, "After drinking your cola that was in the fridge, I replaced the cola with a beer."
Instead of saying "within 7 to 10 days of opening", why not just "within 10 days of opening"? Strange construction of sentence.
Can you tell us the situation that led to such a question? Why do you need such a word? How did you try to look for such a thing? Have you checked out a thesaurus already for 'prick', 'stick' or 'pierce'?
These look like beads... What do you mean by **findings**? Where do you want to use the word? What context?
_I have heard that Go is the shortest verb in English._ Where did you hear this heresy? What makes _go_ shorter than _be_? _Be_ is a verb. So is _is_. So is _ax_. One could make an argument for [OK](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/OK?q=ok), too.
Why do you think it is "English" notation? What has it to do with the language?

Are you looking for *logical* examples or *real* ones? Like, for example, "impossible" clearly represents one end of a spectrum (probability = 0) whereas "possible" represents the entire rest of it (probability > 0), so *logically* we shouldn't be able to say "very impossible" or "more impossible"; but *in reality*, [the latter is not uncommon, and the former is at least attested](http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph  very+possible%2Cmore+possible%2Cvery+impossible%2Cmore+impossible&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corp  15&smoothing=3&share=).

I'm curious...does your native language or some other language you know have the construct that you feel is missing from English?
So you're trying to find a single word version of 'less short' or 'less ugly' or 'less (anything)'. There isn't one in English. (There isn't one in German, where there is no two word for 'more X', you always say 'X-er'). Why? One can only guess, and I'd say because that relation is easily said the other way 'A is (less X) than B' = 'A is 'unX'-er than B: "A is less-short/taller than B").
[ODO](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/re--emerge?q=re-emerge) and [Collins](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/reemerge?showCookiePolicy=true) dictionaries both have ***re-emerge***. Have you checked any dictionaries? If not, please do so first rather than expecting others to do so for you. If you have, then please indicate what research you have done to avoid others repeating it.
Have you tried asking on linguisticsSE? Perhaps, languages other than English have something to do with the question as well.
I don't understand the question. "This might clear **what** up"? That introduction and @JohnLawler comments referring to "They" & "markers" with no indication of what is being referred to, suggest that this is a continuation of an earlier discussion in a parallel universe.  Please clarify for those of us in *this* universe!
Out of curiosity, does the German version have a similar pair to English, and are there similar nuances of distinction like those given in the answers?

Why is it more parsimonious to have one derived from the other rather than both diverge from a single meaning? How do you choose the simpler of X->Y, Y->X, Z->X,Y, especially when the data is impoverished. Having fewer hypothetical roots could be considered the most parsimonious.

Initially I read your fourth paragraph as meaning "connotations of [someone/people] sexually alluring women" ("alluring" as a verb). I assume you mean "connotations of *sexually-alluring* women" (women who are sexually alluring)?
I believe this question would be improved by including a dictionary definition of _reincarnate(d)_, as well as a description of the character in question. Are these young-looking hands on a beautiful young woman? Or Goddess-like hands on an otherwise old and wrinkly woman? Without such context, it's hard to suggest a better word.
Which words did you find when you looked for synonyms, and why were they not satisfactory? (This information would save people suggesting words that you have already rejected.)
What is your context? It's hard to answer the first part of your question without knowing. Also, did you look up each of these words in a dictionary? If not, perhaps you should start there. On the other hand, if you've already checked a dictionary, perhaps you should share your findings here, so we need not scurry to consult our dictionaries, lest we post something erroneous.
The prize is in the North quadrant from here. (Don't know whether you count the spaces as 'characters' - but you could change "The prize" to "It".) I assume you mean it cannot be further south than NE or NW? Or you could say "between NE & NW from here".
Oh, and don't forget *bourgeois* and *petite-bourgeoisie*. And why "upper-middle class" specifically: should it exclude the upper classes?
It hardly seems that a word **stronger** than snob is needed. A snob will not ask you if you slept well or enjoyed the food! Unless he means, "how do these fine accommodations compare to that hovel which you call your home?"  Someone who is more interested in watching television than conversing with some strangers is hardly a snob on account of that.
@Reddast as you noted, it does look similar to wall anchors- could it be something related to the winged plastic or toggle bolt anchors [here](http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/inffastener/infanchor/infanchor.html)? It also reminds me a little of a screw cast...
In what way are you disappointed with the existing answers? You have excellent answers to your 1st and 3rd questions (because they are answered definitively by an etymology and list respectively).

I take that to mean that if a bird was on a lower branch of a tree, you could say *nel..* or *dentro* - but if it really was *inside* (eg, in a cavity in the trunk), you would say *dentro*.  Right?

_And did those Feet / in ancient time / walk upon England's mountains green? / And was the holy Lamb of God / on England's pleasant pastures seen? / And did the Countenance Divine / shine forth upon these clouded hills? / And was Jerusalem builded here / among these dark Satanic mills?_ - Blake was almost certainly insane, but he did prove that you can write some beautiful, stirring nationalist nonsense while starting sentences with prepositions. This is one of those rules - like never splitting infinitives - that probably ought to be retired.
In your final paragraph, what "three examples previously listed"?

Hey, it was good enough for Shakespeare: *But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? / It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.*
The OED has entire section, section III, on the use of *and* for starting things off. **11. Continuing the narration: a. from a previous sentence, expressed or understood. b. from the implied assent to a previous question or opinion, = Yes! and; as ‘Will you go?’ ‘And take you with me.’ ‘This applies to all men, I suppose?’ ‘And to women too.’ 12 In expressing surprise at, or asking the truth of, what one has already heard.** Similar things can be found for the other conjunctions.

I don't quite follow your argument at the end of your second paragraph. Your BF says "Neither of us *is* ..." You think it should be "Neither *one* of us *is* ..." - So you are *in agreement* on the verb form. Hence I'm not clear what the next 2 sentences are referring to, when you still conclude that "is" is correct. I have a recollection of reading in another Q. that with joint subjects, each of which requires a different verb form, then the subject nearer the verb dictates the verb form. OTOH, that would require *am* in your orig.quote! Or is the subject simply "Neither", which takes "is"?
It could well be that there are different answers to this question in different parts of the English-speaking world, e.g. UK v. US, but also does the Indian sub-continent have completely different derivations? Do you have any particular region in mind?

There's no question about the *it* here. The issue is with incorrect composition of the sentences. The second sentence begins after forgetting what precisely has been said in the first sentence and makes preposterous assumptions. You still find it "clear"? What does it convey (mean) to you?
Wow, I didn't know soccer/football had chant leaders. Do we also have those in Europe? I have never heard of this phenomenon (I'm Dutch). Note also that the most common chant sung by Ajax fans, the main Amsterdam football club, is "Jews! Jews!", because Amsterdam is stereotypically a Jewish city. The Rotterdam fans often chant back "Jews to the gas!" as a jocular reply, which is somewhat controversial...football fans are generally rowdy folks here, especially the hard core. But I'm not sure they have a leader specifically coördinating such chants... Incidentally, Kapos led concentration camps.
It may well just be a maths thing: "Let _W_ denote the probability", unless you are _sure_ they are initials, _W_ is one of the classic letters used for variables in math. Also, "_Frequency_ of _duration_"makes no sense at all, don't you mean just _Frequency_?

So, you are saying you know *bugbear* but not *ratbane*?
Are you specifically concerned with describing cases where one string overlaps another *except for a single character?* Supposing there was a word **mmmph** with precisely that meaning, so we could say *ABC mmmphs AB*. Would you want it to *also* be valid to say *AB mmmphs ABC*, or is that a different situation from your point of view? Realistically, how much use would such a word be? It would tend to imply that *ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO mmmphs ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP* is of no more significance than *AB mmmphs AQ*. In the real world, the first case is probably important, and the second is just trivial.

This is neither here nor there, but I once had a copyeditor who abhorred ***“a number of”*** with a fiendish passion. “And just what number did you have in mind there, three? Thirteen? Thirty-seven?” he would scribble at me in withering red. “Don’t write *a number of*; use *several of*, *some of*, *many of* or even if you must *a few of* instead,” he would constantly hector. He’s gone now, but like the burnt child who fears fire, I still cringe whenever I catch myself writing *a number of*, haunted by the posthumous spectre of editorial retribution for what’s really a simple little phrase.
So, janoChen, do you want the word to explicitly convey a belief "that men are superior to or more important than women"? If so, you should probably edit your question to reflect that.

At the bottom of the jar? Or the bottom of the pot? I think the word you are looking for is [_dregs_](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dregs), and I think the site you are looking for is [ell.SE].
Re @J.R.'s comment, you take coffee or tea out of a jar (or tin or packet or box or whatever) before making it. So do you want to know what to call the stuff at the bottom of your cup _after_ you make it when it's wet and in your cup or pot? Actually one can say 'tea leaves' or 'coffee grounds' for both before and after, but one usually says 'tea leaves' for afterwards when 'reading' them. I don't know if people say or do 'reading coffee grounds'. You definitely don't say 'reading dregs'. But if you're just referring to the crud at bottom of your cup, then 'dregs' is the word.

Is your *professor* a native speaker? It seems very unlikely a *thoughtful* Anglophone would deliberately use such unusual phrasing to a ***non-native*** speaker. When we use "non-standard" wording like this, it's normally a "flag" alerting the other person to the fact that there's some unusual *nuance* implied. A bit nonsensical in this case anyway - obviously "pregnancy" isn't the intended nuance, but why on earth would the teacher want to say you're ***more than one** ordinary person*, rather than just ***one extraordinary person***? Personally, I've absolutely no idea!
Are you sure the professor didn't say **more than _an_ ordinary person**? To the ear, there wouldn't be a whole lot of difference between "more than one" and "more than an." And I wonder, what was the nature of the assignment?

You want a single word that describes _improbable calamity_? Good luck with that one. I'm curious about why you believe such a word even exists; after all, we could take any word pair, and ask for single words that convey the meanings of both words, like _remarkable recurrence_ (something that happens regularly yet remains tirelessly inspiring), or _battlefield miracle_ (something paranormal event that happens amidst an armed conflict).
How about *negligible*?
Do you mean "topics"? Or "areas"? "Topics" makes me think something along the lines of "topic for a paper." It's hard to tell if _lorem ipsum_ in your examples refers to behavioral problems or academic problems. If I'm catching your meaning, I'd be inclined to use something like, "Areas that could be improved: lorem ipsem."
Which dictionary says : Tight fit means a good joke?
Are you sure that "tight fit" means "good joke" – and not something more along the lines of "especially approproiate joke?" Some jokes are funny because there is an element of truth to them, or an impersonator might say something you could easily imagine being said by the person they are impersonating. I could see _those_ jokes being called "tight fits."

Today on the BBC, the chief vexillologist of the UK weighed in on the long-standing controversy between people who call the UK's flag the "Union Jack" and people who call it the "Union Flag".  The official position?  **Get over it** - there never *was* a rule until the Victorians (who had to have rules about everything) decided to make one.  Many language nitpicks (such as dangling prepositions and split infinitives) came out of the same misguided fussiness, and should also be ditched. If obeying the "rule" makes your writing awkward or unclear, forget the rule!
Andrey, thank you for asking this question. The mismatch between the normal usage of "unlock" and its meaning in regard to achievements confused me for a long time, and still bothers me. It seems to me that even in video games (except for achievements), "unlocking" something means that it becomes *ready* to be opened or accessed. I always wondered, "If these are my unlocked achievements, what do I need to do now to achieve them? And why are the others locked?" Maybe my question is more specific than yours: why does gaming use the word *unlock* for achieving an achievement?

Maybe I am missing something here but I don't actually see what the problem is. Digits don't have capitalizations. If you started a sentence with a digit it would just be the digit. Can you provide examples of each option you call out?
Would you not use _what's the matter_?
Your edit doesn't really make sense... neither "Is there a matter?" nor "I could tell that there was a matter." are valid constructions. You've also added content to the question that the existing answers do not address, which is generally discouraged on SE.
I must be missing something. *Into* clearly specifies direction. The direction is clearly B → A. B is going to join A to be part of A. B is the smaller of the two to boot, though that's not really relevant. What's relevant is that you end up with A and no B. So clearly B has been merged into A, and A has *not* been merged into B. What happened to A is that it "took over B" or "acquired B" or whatever. Anyway, all of this is really very straightforward. So what is the question?
how about *neglect*?

You are cheating, of course. *Fastest* is a superlative, and *sleeping* is a present participle.

What else are they?

Cruncher: Exactly. And you are having a problem with that because...? There *is* an infinite number of words *already*, I hope you do realize that. In no small part precisely thanks to suffixes. There are in fact entire suffix chains that can be repeated ad infinitum, like *ize* and *ation*.
Is this about how certain animals are often given certain human first names *if they are given a first name at all*? Or is this about how animals *are move often given human first names* than in other languages in general? As to the first question, other languages certainly have human first names that are more common for certain animals. Dutch *Berta* is typical for cows, *Minoes* for female cats, *Henk* for a male horse, etc. But there may be fewer such connections than in English. Dutch does have a lot of first names that are exclusive to animals, like *Kwak*, *Vlekkie* ("Spot"), etc.
Are you saying "giving first names" as in, "the name for this gender of that species is"? Because "giving a name" means "naming" which would be like giving your dog the name Fido.

Available' is also one of those words like 'unique' where some might contest whether it can exist in degrees.

What's wrong with *I have been certified in web development by Microsoft*? That said, I would specify the actual certification you hold.

No, it's the first meaning: a small stream.  (The "call", and the "chorus" it "sings", refer to the noise of the water flowing: brooks are often described as "babbling".)

Why would you need to distinguish a ***Marxista*** from a ***Marxist*** anyway? I'm not sure there are many contexts where *-ista* would make any more sense than *-ist*. Except maybe if you think there's a possibility the word with the "standard" ending won't imply your negative opinion of whoever you're referring to. To be honest, I think *Guardianista* is modeled on *fashionista*, and for most native speakers, *-ista* probably has no independent meaning apart from that one "original".
Do you want a word that means both at once, or words for each emotion separately?
For one thing, the dictionary seems to provide the "to be able to buy or to do something" part more as a helpful additional information than as the definition itself: "to have enough money or time," so you are not left wondering "enough for what?" --> "to be able to" is not inherent in the definition and needs to be explicitly stated when using *afford*.

What is the difference between "*formal English*" and "a formal style/register of standard English"? For #2, if you're meaning a formal style, then which type of formal style are you talking about?

It seems very clear that _working_ in this case is a verb (especially with the `-ing` suffix). Could you expand on why you think it could be used as a noun in that phrase?

Could you expand a little on this? In the most commonly known version of "archaic" English, the distinction between "ye" and "you" is not one of number but one of case: as the question says, "ye" was used as a subject pronoun, and "you" as an object pronoun. But you seem to be saying here that in Kerry, "ye" is used as a plural form of "you".

What do you mean 'better'? It works just fine for most people. What are your criteria for 'better'? Shorter? more formal? Less visually arresting? Why do people still 'hang up' their phone?
I don't understand the problem. When dictionaries recognizes a definition of a word to mean "(for a river) to overflow", then why _shouldn't_ a journalist use that word in a headline or news story? The fact that the word happens to mean something else in other contexts doesn't change it's validity. It would be like asking "Why do they call it a heart _attack_, when _attack_ means when one army fights another?" Call the usage metaphorical if it makes you feel better. Moreover, you've answered your own question, in a way; if you don't like _burst_, what's wrong with _flood_?

Hi there. This might be a better question for English learners: http://ell.stackexchange.com/. Also, you might want to edit the title question to be more specific (eg Is it "got started" or "started"?).
Your question in its present state is inchoate. We need more information about the purpose of your project. Is it to provide a ledger in chart form; you know, column #1 is student's name; colum #2 is "dates of stay"; column #3 is room charges; column #4 is mess charges? If so, the title of the project could be "Hostel-Student Ledger."
Assuming someone has commissioned you to complete this project, why not ask him/her to explain in a cogent sentence or two what s/he is after? In your shoes, I wouldn't assume I know what is expected of me; rather, I would put the onus on the person who is giving me the assignment to provide at least a working title for it. That should clarify things for you. If s/he has difficulty summarizing the project "in a nutshell," at least get an overall purpose for it, or perhaps a list of what rubrics should be included.

Both of them lack imagination and as far as I'm concerned are an abuse of English. I wouldn't touch either with a barge pole, and as for 'no worries' that is even worse. (Why would anyone have the impertinence to suggest that I might be worried?) If one must speak in cliché, then '...it's a pleasure', '...don't mention it', or '...not at all', all indicate a more mature facility with the language.

Is it your company that does the work in each case? There are the terms *contractor*, *prime contractor*, and *sub-contractor,* where all these parties are contractors performing work on the program but the sub-contractors perform work for the prime, and the prime is responsible to the customer.  Are you trying to name the prime contractor's relationship with respect to the sub's?  That is still just a customer-contractor relationship.
They are both *customers/clients* to you.  Maybe there's a need to differentiate between *individual* clients and *corporate* clients?

@epizeuxis The translators may have gone with "indescribable" because there is literally no English word!

*from*, not *in*; unless the movies are themselves quoting from something else. Get the point?
Yes, both constructions are acceptable. Are you asking whether one is "better" (or more accepted) than the other? I don't think it would raise eyebrows either way.
Is it '[truism](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/truism)' you're looking for? One connotation of it is that it is a statement repeated often and so taken as true, though not necessarily justified.
Dictionary definitions hardly ever say everything. Also, you didn't specify 'unjustified' in your question. Is that what you want? Either way, none of these are unjustified, just their justification is put in to question.
for the third one do you want a *word* or a *shape*? If a word, then if I grasp it correctly **polyhedron**.
For 1 and 2, there are *disc* and *circle*: are you asking whether there is a generalised pair of words?
The usage also strikes me as odd. Do you have further context or a source where this sentence was encountered? What I would expect to hear/read in this case is that: *Catering at a school is done through a concession to Company A.* Now I wonder whether the more interesting question is "What is the difference between franchises and concessions?"
Incomprehensible! (That's a joke, by the way - My point is that many words have multiple prefixes and suffixes, and may have evolved in such a way that the prefixes and suffixes have ceased to have meaning distinct from the word as a whole. What do you want to use this dictionary for?)
You could also have suggested the words "reprobates" or "heretics" or "apostates." I kind of like "The Poles think of their Czech neighbors as reprobates." Come to think of it, "pagan" isn't bad, either. How about "a bunch of backsliders"?
How about 'bloody stupid'?

I think the question should be rephrased to eliminate the purely subjective "pleasantness" of a spoken accent. Also, I fail to see how etymology would affect a listener's perception of an accent?
Unless you can identify how you "measure" pleasant, it will be very hard to find any answer. Personally, I find the Indian accent more pleasant than the Spanish. If your question is why _you_ find the Spanish more pleasant, how can we answer that? It is a matter of taste. If you can give examples of _differences_ in the accents, we might try to find explanations for it :)
Hey, how about the question reads like this: "IF you agree that .... then why is it .... ?" I'm not sure if people are being PC trolls or what...
I have no problem with the word pleasant, apart from it being subjective. Honestly, there is no PC motive in trying to point out that subjectivity. But "more pleasant" is as useful as "I feel a Belgian accent is more orange than a German one. How come?"
What are the reasons why English with an Indian accent is more attractive than English with a Spanish accent to some people and less attractive to others? might be an interesting question, though it is too wide for this site: Linguistics might be interested.  But 'Which accent do you think this person finds more attractive and why?' is off-topic, purely opinion-based, and far too broad. 'Which accent do you find more attractive?' is in addition mildly offensive. And GUESSING is not what we do here.

None of the words shown so far on this page (whoosh, splash, sploosh) correspond to "*an object passing through water for a prolonged period of time*", IMO. For that, you will need to give a better idea what you mean: what kind of object, for instance? The sound of an object traveling underwater depends mostly on the size and shape of the object. The words given so far correspond to an object hitting the water, including the ensuing sound of the moving water. They do not correspond to the sound of an object moving through the water.

I'm not sure I understand.  What is "Index 2"?  How can there be multiple of them (unless we're talking CS, and they're from multiple arrays, in which case they wouldn't be surrounded by two "indices 3")?  Typically "the index" would be used when referring to a specific index, and "an index" would be used to refer to a generic index.
The fact of the matter is a phrase meaning "the truth"/"in truth". Whereas in "matter of the fact" each word is to be taken with its primary meaning. Are you sure you're not mistaking "matter of the fact" with "matter of fact" which is another idiom?
Why would you think it's not "proper"? This looks like writing advice to me.

"Best" can be pretty tricky to parse syntactically and can introduce other nuances, see [here](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/27021/do-i-need-to-put-the-before-most-in-this-sentence). In "I fought the best", I would parse "I" as the subject, "fought" as the verb and "the best" as an adverbial phrase. I see the semantic ambiguity but not syntactically.

“Protestant parts of the U.S.”? Huh? Never heard of such a thing.

Possible duplicate of [English words of Latin origin: Did they replace existing words?](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/137044/english-words-of-latin-origin-did-they-replace-existing-words) . Note that it matters greatly whether you take an unweighted percentage of words noted in a particular dictionary ( you will get many more Latinate words) or whether you weigh the words by frequency (many more Germanic words). The latter is equivalent to counting the word *the* in a corpus every time it occurs; the former is equivalent to counting *the* only once in the entire (same) corpus.
Why do you think it could be different with the *-ly* adverbs? Any thing you can add can be helpful to answer.

Can I vote that this question be set on fire?
*But in careful prose, you wouldn't respond I do/don't" to a question starting with "have" as in "have you got", would ya?*" No, and AFAICT it is a myth that Americans typically answer that way. IMO, to "*Have you got a dog?*" they typically answer "*Yes, I have*", "*Yes, I've got a dog*", "*No, I haven't*", or "*No, I haven't got a dog*". To "*Do you have a dog?*" they typically answer "*Yes, I do*" or "*No, I don't.*"  This is not the first time I've heard this claim, however.  I'm speaking from my experience, including my paying attention since decades ago when I first heard the claim.
Sure, they do. "*Haven't you got a car?*"  See the reference you cited, where it says *However it is perfectly normal to say "Have you got a pen?" rather than "Do you have a pen?"*
How about it?  You already described it as "nonstandard." You will find some Americans who say anything.  After all, they come from everywhere and can have learned English, or partly learned it, anywhere. ;-)
Might I please be so forward as to courteously suggest that you consult [this very strongly related question](http://spanish.stackexchange.com/a/3406) for some specific examples of this?  I’m not certain your question is a perfect duplicate of that one, but it is unquestionably related.
What research have you done so far?
If you don't care about the real-world answer, why should we bother?
What exactly do you mean by *"**involved** in the arts"*? For example, would this include people with no creative talent or aspirations, who donate time and/or money to theatres, for example? What about those who just like to *appreciate* art (go to exhibitions, etc.)?
There are several words. Do you mean from the perspective of those with faith, as in 'lost their path', or from the perspective of those who don't rely on faith, such as 'disillusioned', or do you mean from a neutral point of view, such as 'found something else to fill their life'? Please give an example of what perspective you're looking for.
So what's wrong with "treasure"? I think "idol" is a bit weird (unless metaphorically applied to *people*, the word smacks strongly of a "religious totem" for primitives). "Pearl" might be okay in some contexts, but it's pretty figurative/flowery.
What dictionary did you use? http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hustle has a number of definitions - positive, negative, and neutral.
The first, at least, is grammatical. But what exactly do you need to know?
You really need to tell us more. 'My own condemnation' is potentially ambiguous. 'My own car' clearly means the car which I own. But with an abstract noun like 'condemnation', one needs to be clear about what it is condemnation of. Could 'my own condemnation' mean 'the condemnation of me' (either by myself or another)? Or could it mean 'my own condemnation of something else'that is harming me? Perhaps you could put all this into a wider context.

What exactly do you mean by "quality"? If the answer is "that's a subjective assessment which the user must determine" then why not just call your metric "quality"? Without knowing exactly what you want it to mean (if anything), I don't see how you can get anything here apart from a list of different people's ideas about what *they* might wish to measure. Which could be *happiness, efficiency, profitability, simplicity,* etc. How do we know?

@Thale What do you mean by "a verb for identifying"? This would mean that you want to describe the action of identifying. Are you looking for an adjective to describe such a woman, or a noun by which to name her?
I wouldn't use "entails" here. The dictionary definition of the word allows it, but the most usual meaning is that B is a component part of A. *Housekeeping entails cooking, cleaning, laundry...* Readers might mistake the meaning as "you can't have A without B". I don't see anything wrong with "from A there follows B", though it sounds a bit terse and inelegant in that compressed form. But when A and B are replaced by phrases denoting mathematical procedures, it will read smoothly enough. Could you not say, "From A, it follows that...", or "The logical consequence of A is..."?

Voulez-vous dire "évaluer les performances de l'algorithme en chaque cas", ou "évaluer la performance de l'algorithme globalement"? Je pense que dans le premiere cas, en anglais il peut être pluriel, mais dans le deuxième il doit être singulier. (Please pardon my French as I haven't used it regularly for years.) _Do you mean "to evaluate each instance of the algorithm in each instance", or "evaluate the general performance of the algorithm"? I think in the first case, it can be plural, but in the second it must be singular._

Depending on your language and environment, couldn't you build the stats functionality into a library/module/class and invoke it from both your team and player code? You should be able to avoid inappropriate code duplication without combining the team and player code into an odd superclass. The stats library/module/class could provide an interface that would allow the team and player code blocks to separately identify the types of stats that might be accumulated for teams or players respectively.
Performer? It's not great but might fit as a class name. Both players and teams can be performers with regard to stats which are analysing their performance.
Heh, can we claim loanwords? *keffiyeh*, *tabouleh*…
In general, when can we precede a subject by a verb? is amusingly self-referential. As to declarative sentences, you can do that any time, that's called a hyperbaton.

If there was, then there probably wouldn't be that idiom. Maybe, or maybe not. Usually, the more words used, the easier it is to finesse a more specific meaning. Perhaps try the old classic version of *Roget's Thesaurus* (1983 or earlier?). It's great for a rainy day . . .
You might get more appropriate "one word" candidates if you provided the context and the specific sentence. For in that way, we'll know what kind of meaning that you are wanting. For if the idiom is already a very good fit for that sentence, then it'll probably be a better choice than "one word" candidates. But, if the idiom doesn't quite fit in your sentence, then we'll see that and know which way to go in trying to find a better phrase or word for that sentence. So, could you provide us the actual sentence?

As I understand it, the playoff series would be between 2 teams, while the league season will have involved a lot more teams (all playing each other, home and away?).

Exactly how "th" (as /θ/ or /ð/) is articulated varies considerably according to several factors (which specific speaker, how carefully he's speaking, what phonemes come before and after it, etc.). Personally, the tip of *my* tongue is usually *way* back behind the teeth when I articulate /ð/ after /s/ in, say, *"What's the matter?"*. But it's much further forward if /ð/ occurs at the start of a *stressed* syllable such as *"How's **this** for an example?"*.

@krowe if you understand this point, it's very unclear from your question, which seems to be asking why one rule of English is incongruous with the rules of English.

If the former, you need to make the question say so clearly. If the latter, your question makes an assumption which is wrong and can only be answered by explaining the wrong assumption.

Though those forms may be common in Indian English, it is common when using English as a foreign language to not use the question transformation rule: To make a why question out of "Bob is tall" (which is correctly "Why is Bob tall?") sometimes one uses the simplest strategy of just adding the question word up front "Why Bob is tall?".
Do you perceive any difference between "*is able to X*" and "*is able **to be** Xed*"?
You mean other than *bullshitting*?
I must ask, are restrictions not simply a lack of permissions and thus nearly the same thing? To justify this a little, thinking in the context of computing, a user is assumed to have no permissions until they are granted and so restrictions are a simple lack of being given permissions.
So where, in your scenario, is someone attributing inappropriate motives to another's actions?   I thought your scenario would be along the lines of: A two-man team wins a large sum of money which is given to the team leader.  The partner never gets a split and assumes the leader is being a selfish jerk when really the leader spent all the money to help his partner's son get out of a tight spot that he didn't want his father to know about.
What do you mean by a "computer addict"? A social media addict is different from a computer addict. If a person is a computer addict, then it means that they're enthusiastic about digging into computers and learning more, and that can make them geeky.
What's wrong with just spelling it out (since so few understand your made-up acronym)?

You’ve already said that it caused the crash. Why would you need to say it again?  “This is the crash-causing error that caused the crash” seems needlessly repetitive and redundant.  I suppose you could say *original error* or *originating error*, but I still think “that caused the crash” has enough info in it.

Well to me and many other people apple and oranges are "different" although they are both fruits. And in any case the meaning of the expression is pretty clear universally. Comparable respect to what ? Frankly, I don't see logical consistency in your line of reasoning.

Since it is ultimately a stylistic issue, what other way would people expect you to do it than "your" way?
Are you just talking about the list of parts, rather than the complete instructions? For instance if you’ve seen a Lego or Ikea instruction booklet, are you referring to the inventory they provide at the beginning?
It's the second one that looks strange, sounds strange, and makes no sense to boot. The rule is that "uncle's" means "belonging to the uncle", while "uncle" simply means "uncle". Just like with any other word, really. So "uncle's sister" is the sister of the uncle, while "uncle sister" is your sister who is also your uncle.

I doubt there are any *specific* terms, but (a) What do you mean by "discrimination"?, and (b) What do you mean by "mechanical parts"? If border security staff suspect a guy with a pacemaker might actually be a suicide bomber carrying "self-embedded" explosives, that's kinda different to a woman not fancying a guy with a glass eye.
Apart from being slightly ridiculous in the context of the preceding sentence, your *third* usage is completely unnecessary. Just delete the words *exposure to* there. I don't see anything much wrong with leaving the first two as they are - but if it bothers you, just merge the first two sentences using a comma, and delete *humans are constantly exposed* as well (if it's sprayed on the inside walls of homes, it's blindingly obvious people are exposed/in close proximity, so why bother spelling it out?).

All of the English sentences you proposed (1-5) are correct grammatically. How are we supposed to suggest which of them (or something else) might be an appropriate translation of that Italian sentence (let alone the most appropriate), **if we do not understand Italian**?  This does not seem like a good question for this site, because it seems to be a question about translation from Italian.
The answer: it depends. :) The version *"Did you hear that Sally broke her leg?"* might be preferable when the speaker is focusing on the event that Sally's leg got broken. While the version *"Did you hear that Sally has broken her leg?"* might be preferable when the speaker is focusing on the present time implication of Sally having a broken leg (that Sally won't be coming on the hike tomorrow due to that broken leg). There's also the version with the backshift: *"Did you hear that Sally had broken her leg?"*
Perhaps **Scrotesque**?
There is not remotely enough information to provide a correct answer. Does it describe the person or the life? Was it their own fault? Did they come out of it to be a better person, or did they collapse and give up? Is it a venerable expression or a recent coining? Elevated language or colloquial?

It would be very helpful if you could post links to the sentence you cite about the concert and to the Band of Brothers comment.  Related to the concert, have you eliminted the possibility that the comment was being used in an ironic or sarcastic way?  Also, is this an actual comment or just one you made up?  Because I think if you could point to some real examples not made-up ones it would allow for much more accurate analysis.
I know you've tagged it as `american-english` but all those words would be pronounced with _you_ in almost every British accent (with the possible exclusion of a heavy Belfast accent who still wouldn't use 'oo'). Australian's would pronounce it as _you_, slightly extended and South African (English) would be _you_ but clipped a bit. Is it possible that those areas where it is pronounced _you_ are heavily influenced by British accents? Do you know where that pronunciation is common (in the US)?
I meant 'styou-dent' is not just common but standard in the UK, while 'stood-ent' is the US pronunciation I know from people from all parts of the US (I don't do IPA either). What I meant when I asked 'where?' was where in the US are those words pronounced the same as in the UK.

I'm not quite clear about the context you're describing. Mostly it seems you're talking about a situation involving some kind of "quick fix", which would normally be ***decided upon AND carried out quickly***.

I think the problem is that you want something that is related to a *particular* era, but then are asking for a general term that means related to *an* era. In use this is of no value:  *This chair is from an era.* Yes, ok, and??  To be of use you should identify the *particular* era:  *This chair is Victorian.*  Now, I don't need to use your word at all; I just use the adjective for the *particular era* in question. And if you don't know the particular era, you can just say it's *antique* ;-)

@ivanhoescott Well, that settles it then: [if God said it](http://www.lolcatbible.com/indextitle=Genesis_1&), who are we to argue?
There is what can be said, what should be said, what was said, and what was heard. When you, OP, ask such questions, my question to you is "acceptable to whom?" Who is the audience? What level of acceptance would properly answer your question? On target: Is the statement grammatically correct? Yes. Is the statement understood by an audience in grammar, content, and context? Yes. Is the statement allowed to be stated as such? Yes. Given this, what do you want to know?
Back to my original comment: What answer could be given to your question that you'd accept? Even if an answer said, "that's not formal" and even the comments here say as much, it's just people expressing opinions: their own or cited from elsewhere. If the statement was used in what you considered a formal setting, and the audience didn't express displeasure in the terminology utilized, one could reasonably assume that the statement was accepted -- as stated -- in a formal setting. Even if authoritatively asserted that the usage was "incorrect", it changes nothing that it was used.
Why did you send me this link? is perfectly polite.
I dunno - I think it becomes a bit pointless trying to analyse the exact syntax of such archaic/poetic text to that level. Can you honestly say it makes any significant difference to the overall meaning whichever interpretation you place on it? Personally, I struggled more with ***corse*** (which I've eventually decided must mean ***corpse***, since ***course*** doesn't exactly work for me).

The same ambiguity exists in your original.

I think you may have demonstrated above that you already have an intuitive understanding of the main distinction (insofar as there *is* a difference). *Which* always implies selecting something *from some set of possible choices*, so the answer to *"Which do you want?"* should be restricted to items on the menu (or otherwise contextually "available"). But *"What do you want?"* could be answered by *anything* that you want, even if it doesn't exist, and has never been thought of by the person asking for your preference.

If the scheduled launch on *Monday* was thwarted by there being a sailboat in the ***danger zone***, that implies to me it was cancelled *to protect the sailboat, not the rocket*. I don't know (does anyone, *yet?*) why the rescheduled launch failed, but it may have something to do with the rescheduling. In which case it's somewhat ironic that the accident may have effectively been caused by following procedures intended to ***increase overall safety***. But a tiny risk reduction for a (relatively low value) sailboat may have led to a huge increase in risk for a very expensive rocket.
Although there is still some confusion. First you state you are looking for "'expecting' couple", for which Colin Fine gave an answer. Then you give examples with "expecting a baby.child". These two are not interchangeable: _He was the first to break the news about your expecting couple_ makes no sense. So which one do you want?
In OP's context I'd just go with ***and other sociologiocal issues***. Most such issues (religion, equality, sexual standards, racial integration, etc.) are intimately interleaved with *political* and *educational* processes. Why would we expect a special word for all aspects of social organisation that aren't very closely related to either of those two? Offhand I can think of *popular entertainment* as being a big chunk, but even that is only a small part of the (ill-defined, and thus probably inherently nameless/unnameable) thing being envisaged here.
Shouldn't it be _could **not** see_? _for_ means _because_.
What do you say in your language?
How about "pun"?
It's fine. "ending" = "coming to an end" here. Why the doubt?
A gerund is a verb used as a noun, e.g. *At the ending of an era, a new one starts*. But I am not clear that 'I see no sign of the story ending' is a gerund. How can *ending* be a noun in that phrase?
Why do you limit #4 to "proper names". Does it not apply to all nouns?
It seems to me that you might have made some surprising claims of what *CGEL* says and doesn't say. Could you please insert some supporting evidence for your claims?
Are you asking why *this work is of interest*, is the same thing as saying *this work is interesting*? The honest answer is that I don't know. But then I don't know why we use many idiomatic forms.
What makes you think it's not done in American English? AmE is particularly fond of abbreviations. Off the top of my head, _peeps_, _rad_, _bull_, _lit_. What is so special about _journos_ and _musos_ that does not apply to _profs_ or _cops_ or _ammo_?
*Better* and *grammatical* are oblique if not orthogonal; which are you asking about?
Could you verify for me that the expression in the question actually is *"he found crossword puzzles"*, and not _"he found **the** crossword puzzles"_? -- (I'm wondering if perhaps there's a typo in there, or in the SAT prep book, where it's missing the word "the".)
_Emblem?_ - a design or object that is a symbol of something such as a country or organization [[MacMillan](http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/emblem#emblem_4)]
Can you please explain further? What do you mean by "somewhat normal"? It is actually not normal because it is deviating from what is normal. (thus, _abnormal_ is a possible answer). Though _weird_ and _odd_ fit too, why do you think they don't fit?
Do you mean "the set of all possible types of tree" (which is a botanical question) or "the set of all actual trees which exist"? If the former ('domain'? 'class'? etc), see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification

What are you looking for exactly? Please specify that more clearly, describe a situation, and if possible an example sentence in which you want to use the word. One possibility would be **deceased** since that is where the money comes from that the _beneficiaries_ of a will will receive. It could also be **insurance (company)** in the case of the beneficiaries of an insurance policy.

We need more context.  Can you copy&paste the full sentence?  Perhaps there wasn't ground where it was supposed to be...?
They can be synonyms, but I can see _boast_ being used in a positive sense, where _brag_ is (almost?) exclusively _negative_: “This company boasts twenty years' experience in the field” is certainly not bad, but if this company _brags_ about their experience, it is certainly negative.
How is this better than/different from *if and when*?
Yes, you can. However, your intention in using *any* is not clear. It gives the sentence a particular meaning. If that's what you are trying to say, then it's fine. Can you add more detail?
I'm not sure if etymology of Italian cuisine is on-topic here. But maybe the snack looks like a shoe?
A little more context would help. Do you want a geometrical term, for example? A heraldic term?
That aside, what's wrong with "I don't believe it!" or "That's unbelievable!" or "I'm shocked!" or "That is shocking!"?
Are you actually looking for a synonym for "ready to ship"?  Do you want to differentiate between items you are not ready to ship and ones that you are?  The text of your question seems to indicate that the answer to both questions is **no** and that what you are looking for is a less niche-jargon way of describing your service.  But I am not sure, so more context would be good.

Hi, I was just wondering why you changed your coice of answer?   I guess, the reason you asked the question is because:  *only* causes inversion in some sentences, and so you wanted to know when inversion happened  with *only*?
I'd be willing to bet that there is a word or phrase for this in the medical world (@medica?). What I'd really like to know is the word for the reminder ribbon worn only to remind of this. ;-)
Welcome to EL&U. You seem to be asking for writing advice, and "best" is rather subjective, so this question may be put on hold, so I might ask this: if it is tedious, why is it necessary to repeat so often? Is it not enough to have "B is one fourth as big as A" or "B is one quarter the size of A" or "A is quadruple the size of B"?
The simple answer is that "must" is a command, and "should" is a suggestion.  However, the complete answer is more complicated than that.  Can you provide any more context for your question?
Also, are you looking for a medical term or a layman's term?

I suppose it's *possible* the expression was used (on rare occasions) in the mid-1800s, but I'd have thought that would be largely irrelevant to it being revived/coined by cartoon characters later. Warner, Disney, etc., wouldn't want *any* of their target audience to see it as a "minced oath", since that would still be potentially offensive to some. Whatever - my guess is *sufferin' succotash* is a much more recent coinage, and your website is just making things up. Did ***any*** Victorian ever use *cheese and rice* "euphemistically"? I kinda doubt it, myself.
A catcher title for this question would have been: “What the hell is ‘the hell’ for in this sentence?” :)

It's not clear to me what you're asking about the "slope of the alley." There isn't actually an alley, of course; it's an idiom. Are you talking about when the phrase is applied to a domain of expertise/interest that has literal alleys? ("the bowling tournament was right up my alley", "mugging people was right up his alley") That case seems small enough that there is no established rule about it.
The OED does not really have an example of such modern usage as *risks attendant on use of dangerous equipment*. The nearest I could find was: *1869   J. T. Coleridge Mem. J. Keble iv. 65   Melancholy is a common attendant on poetic genius.* The more I think about it 'on' does appear to be the 'standard' preposition. But 'associated with' does not have quite the same meaning, or does it?
Um...I'm guessing you want something *shorter* to call them. Perhaps this is a single word request? "Shortly" generally is a synonym for "soon" (implying the people are currently being called desert lovers, but some change in terminology is about to happen).

If I understand your question, your company had to resort to "sleight of hand" to solve a problematic issue. (I'm not sure how the word "otherwise" fits in your question.) In other words, the ends (viz., resolving a problematic issue) sometimes justifies the means (viz., sleight of hand), and you need a euphemism other than "hack"?

I think there are too many answers as it all depends on what particular religion/philosophy/behavioural therapy you espouse. Do you mean 'mind control' in the sense that you are able to stay true to your own thoughts and not be overcome by unwelcome ones? Some people are helped by their faith, others prefer secular therapies such as CBT/ACT/mindfulness. Or if you mean you are not easily distracted from the task in hand then you could be *focussed* (complimentary) or suffer from *tunnel vision* (not complimentary).
Why is "open minded" too broad? Sure it *can* mean "open to trying new experiences", but if used in your example "...thoughtful, and open-minded attitudes toward disagreement" it would mean "open to being persuaded by a strong argument".

The name _Graeci_ was used by Greeks coming to Italy (incomers? they were coming into Italy, yes) to refer to the people in the country that they came from. It is not strange or uncommon that such designation over time comprises a larger or different geographical area than than initially. (Iran is named after the Aryans even though Aryans lived also in other places and in the country itself there are plenty of non-Aryans).

You have 1 person's claim of a remembrance of 1 person's experience. If it helps you, OK, but it's not helpful for the site. For something like checking whether a word is/was derogatory, you need more than that to go on, including checking with different groups/communities (since the term labels a group) to see how the term was perceived by them. Was "girl" derogatory if applied to a mature woman in the 40s? The answer might depend on whom you ask, and on the context. And it might depend on an analysis of just what it means for a term to be derogatory (however perceived).
***Why in the world would you ask such a thing?*** I smell a classic X/Y problem here: you want  X and think Y is how to get to X and therefore ask for Y, which hides the real problem domain from those who could help you all because of a false analysis that Y is how you get to X when in fact Y is a batty solution to the X problem. You haven't told us X, only your probably-wrong Y. Tell us X:  ***What are you actually trying to learn?***
I think this is a valid ELU question, but boy did you step in a minefield when you clarified with a comment: "Which is more correct to use in the English language?"

I fail to see why _fire_ is so different fro  _fire at will_. The _at will_ part is independent from the existence of gunpowder. Would you really consider similar questions about _fire when you see the whites of their eyes_, _hold your fire_, _fire at my command_, etc as different questions? All of them share the point that _fire_ in a pre-gunpowder times was probably not used, but why would the rest of the sentence be gunpowder-dependent?
The verb _fire_ is "time-dependent", sure. What makes you think that _at will_ is (1) time dependent and (2) linked to gunpowder?

it’s not uncommon for people to argue that this is the only definition that should be allowed for the word - could you provide a few specific examples?

Wouldn't this be like creating a new part of speech for adjectives used as nouns (e.g. _the rich_) or nouns that are verbed? In this case, doesn't _gerund_ describe the category perfectly?
In general, an *-er* is a practitioner, an *ist* is a believer in the philosophy. And there's *revolutionary* anyway. What meaning are you actually trying to convey? Can you include an example sentence, and maybe the broader context?
That won't help at all. What kind of a person do you mean by "revolutionist?"
Are you saying that _you_ are central, and the other members of the group are distant?

Andy, what would the form of a sufficient or non-a priori argument be for you? All we have is historical evidence, we cant really experiment on populations to see what causes more language diversity.
Andy, I think you have the hypothesis that English is more varied nowadays geographically than others. We should probably define lots first, but for canonical definitions, it's not the case (most European langs have lots of regional dialects; maybe not Russian?).  But let's suppose it _is_ the case. A possible explanation (is it the right form) would be that there is no strong central language authority or strong social adoption tendency. Are you looking for a reason why language X is more diverse than language Y? geographic and social barriers.
Have you tried consulting a thesaurus?
Isn't it the _game_ itself? It is a journey from beginners up to the expert level and each phase is rewarding; rewards usually get bigger also in later phases. If it is not a game, it is _gamification_. Even StackExchange can be an example :)

Why do you think the use of apostrophes is incorrect?
Could you provide the context that you want to use it in?
*Dead weight* is the outcome of editorial laziness. Mathematicians love numbers not words. I happen to love both :-) The $64k question remains: what benefit does a doctoral candidate in mathematics gain by refining his language if his committee doesn't give a rip?

How would you define "usage error"? -- especially, if you are not sure whether such a thing exists? How would one call something an error in a general sense if it was grammatically (and otherwise generally) correct but conflicts with known usage? If there is an answer to this Q, it would be either "Yes, of course!" (as Reg noted) or too broad.
@Bretsky And how exactly is an staff or sceptre magical? Just put the word 'fire' or 'ghoul' in front of any word and it's instantly magical.

This is like asking "Which is better to say, knife or fork?" Both are exactly the right word, depending on what you mean to say.
Also, the OP could (should?) have included what definitions various dictionaries offer today and the various other resources that may have traced the history of the word. Some research effort.
Have you tried looking around for a respectable source guiding on this? In other words, have you tried to find an answer by yourself first?
Why would you expect there to be a word? Do you know such a word in any other language? Is there a word for seeing your neighbour in town, but not getting the chance to speak? Or is there a word for a person who has a different swear word for every month of the year, or for someone who eats fish and chips on Thursdays and a pie on a Friday and plays golf on Saturday?  These sorts of questions which seem to demand that a word be sought to describe any and every circumstance in life become quite tiresome. Why not use some descriptive creativity?
What do you mean “that resemble a  computer”? Those **are** computers!
Why do you keep trying to “rationalize” etymology?  You cannot ever do that.

What is the context for the text? *[At-grade](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/at-grade)* is a technical term and not commonly used by people who are not road engineers, insurance adjusters, or other professionals.
What exactly are you asking? How the Latin root (or really the germanic cognate) became those four meanings? People use words metaphorically. That's how meanings change. Do you not see how they are all at least related? Are those connections for each four what you're looking for? Actually can you edit to show exactly which four definitions you're asking about?

Do you have access to the *full* OED? Their "etymology" section for ***penguin*** is far longer than anything else I can recall seeing there. They start off by saying *Etymology:  Probably Welsh **pen gwyn = white head***, and (eventually! :) finish with *An alternative explanation of the word as an alteration of ‘pin-wing’, referring to the rudimentary wings, is unsupported.*

I don't understand what you're after here, The exact idiom doesn't translate, obviously (it probably wouldn't be an *idiom* if it did). What's wrong with ***damned*** (more rarely, ***damnable***)? That effectively means *may it be damned*, where *to be damned* means ***to be condemned by God to suffer eternal punishment in hell***. Eternal punishment for an *eye* is likely to include "blinding" it.
_Earnestness_ is the noun form of _earnest_. Why can't you just go with that?

What’s this about “British English”??
@dorothy Perhaps your dictionary does not understand North American phonology?  That vowel is tense here, not lax. I grew up just south of the US–Canadian border if that makes any difference, so I have a northern dialect. Southern dialects are different, though — in North America just as in Britain. :)
While it's often used for annoying things, it's not used exclusively for that. Giving presents isn't annoying, is it? The progressive tense makes _always_ less literal -- it's just something they do frequently, not really all the time.
Nope, it is not. I have heard *any more* used in this way, and I always have to think twice before I "oh, that". Note also that standard spelling is two words, with a space: perhaps not using a space in the positive use could be used to mark it as such?
Why is this tagged pronouns? "anti-" is a prefix. I speak American and I say "anti-" with /aɪ/ when dictating the word it in isolation (e.g. in this discussion). If it appears as part of another word (the normal case), then my pronunciation might be influenced by the word it is attached to.
Why do you think it is not possible?
A sport, game, toy, source of amusement, joke: isn't that clear enough? Can you be more specific about why this is not obvious (enough) to you? The connection from playing through joking to making fun of something seems fairly obvious to me; what they have in common is non-seriousness. What kind of an answer do you expect, could you give an example? Do note that the finest semantic changes in the etymology of a word are rarely known; we usually only have a fairly crude idea of what happened based on the evidence.
So, to distinguish this from your linked 'related' questions, are you only asking here if lowercase 'i' for first-person singular nominal is especially common in Indian English online writing than other varieties? You have four questions at the end; frankly the first one is answerable by a statistical study of corpora (easy to state but difficult to actually implement) (and to do otherwise is a bit singling out an ethnicity based on a vague notion of someone's name).
What are "the perceived limitations of the English language"? How is English being limited or constrained here? Are you saying that choosing one capitalization style is limiting? Most European languages do not capitalize nationality 'Ils sont francais' but 'They are French'.

What's wrong with "common misconceptions"?
A _go ahead_ means that you can continue to do something as planned. A _confirmation_ as in your example sentence means that you are told what you already (thought you) knew. These are two different things. Which one are you looking for?
You give boldest examples of 'be like' and then say the question is not about that. So this is unclear. Is your question then about 'know' and 'look'? Those aren't anything like 'be'. They are inflected normally in AAVE like that (without the 's' that standard English has).
I'd love to provide a meaning in the context... if I had some context. Where was the picture taken? What was the issue being protested?
How about "said"?
How about [*anti-genesis*](https://books.google.ca/books  IA-_po38YB0C&pg=PA34&dq=%22anti-genesis%22+origin&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YD9EVfKaLNCwyATYwIEI&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22anti-genesis%22%20origin&f=false) ?
Are you looking for something like a mnemonic for this pair? I think you have everything you need in your explanation already, 'daft' is closer to 'Daffy Duck'. That is, I see nothing in the vowel difference, mid-front and open front, that meaningfully separates the two (the difference and connection to meaning is arbitrary).
Dude, no need to keep stating that you 'recognise the Etymological Fallacy', you either show by your question that you do, or you don't, stating it doesn't make it so. Also, like many questions lately, there is no real answer to 'how' or 'why', there's only description 'that it has done so'. The 'why' is that things change, usually from one thing to a similar one. Maybe you're looking for a missing link because the gap is too large for you? Maybe you're looking for more details to the etymology? And asking 'why' is a great start,  but all there is is 'that' here.
There's a medlar (tree? bush?) in our garden! I wondered what it was called.
@anemone Please explain why you reverted by edit? It's a more accurate title, less sensationalist considering it reached the hot network questions list, and the tags were better!
Which of [these three definitions](http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/LOB) for LOB are you using? Specifically, are you asking about ***3rd-party*** s/w that's vital to the operation of a company, the main application ***sold*** by a s/w house, or the ***general type*** of s/w they sell?
Are you thinking of ERP software?  (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning for details)
The colour *green* is, unremarkably, associated with the environment, and so it is often used as a short, catchy synonym for the more cumbersome phrase *environmentally friendly*. *To go* can often be a synonym for *to become*, as in *to go insane*. So, one might rephrase *we've decided to go green* as *we've decided to become environmentally friendly*. In terms of grammar, *to go* is (counter-intuitively) behaving like a copular verb and *green* is a predicate adjective. As for whether the idiom *to go green* has lost its meaning and become little more than a buzz-phrase, who knows?
Go fish. (Would words like _sheep, deer, quail_, and _fish_ count?)

If words, sentences, and paragraphs are her thing but she can't format them on the computer, what does she do on that computer that makes her "adept" at using it?  It sounds like she types words, sentences, and paragraphs into a word processing program then has someone else actually use the program to format her work.  "Ready for retirement" may be the phrase you're looking for.
I usually like your questions and your answers, and I respect you as a knowledgeable, well-established, high-rep user, but I find the insinuation that some medicines are intentionally marketed to be abused insulting.  What your examples talk about **is** illegal abuse, and the effects mentioned are adverse (undesired) effects, not benefits. They are mostly not hidden, and they are not a selling point of any medicine. HCPs work their asses off trying to help people, and this is what we get for it?
*Studying*, perhaps?

Look carefully - given the way you asked the question I think this is something you know: should the verb agree in number with the subject or with the object? (This type of question is more suited for our sister site: [English Language Learners](http://ell.stackexchange.com/)), but I think this particular one is a matter of mere oversight.
Which English dialect are you asking about? In my part of the UK cotton, mutton and wanton are all pronounced with 'tən'.
What are your criteria for correctness? Must it be a single word? must it be almost exact? English doesn't make new words (at least not well or often) by mushing... argh that's not entirely true: heartache, breadcrumbs, killjoy.

Hi, welcome to ELU! It's really unclear to me why you are asking this question. What does "breakthrough" being a noun have to do with the validity of this sentence? Please edit your question to clarify what you think might be a problem with this sentence.
So, do you want to include things named after a place even if that's _not_ the origin of whatever that thing is?
Which is it: you don't want to call it "pre-built" or "proprietary"... or neither? *Proprietary* would tell me everything you just did: it (only) works as we say it does, you cannot change it and it costs Money. IMO, *plug-and-play* would mean exactly what you need it to mean, to a non-techie. **Proprietary** is what it is though. --Is *appled* a word yet? Perhaps, *applefied*...
Have you encountered "jacket of sorrow" etc. in the wild, or did you just construct these examples for this question?
And that second sign reads "All that park here to visit Starbucks Coffee Company"?
I have *no* idea what any of you are talking about. The sign does not say that all visitors must park. The sign does not say you must or must not dismantle anything. What *on Earth* are y'all talking about? It says a very simple thing in a very straightforward manner. It is not one bit ambiguous. I could not misinterpret it even on purpose. I cannot arrive at any of the alternative meanings listed here, no matter how hard I try. I am at a complete loss.
Are you looking for words like _baleful_ where _bale_ and _ale_ overlap? If yes, I'm sure there are plenty, but I am _not_ sure this site is the right place to construct such a list...
I think the question will probably be closed, because there is no "right" answer (just *lists*, of indeterminate length). But you should still make it clear whether what you're looking for is specifically *single-word* forms (what about multi-word or hyphenated expressions?).
It's "through". ... Where did you find the written text?
If it doesn't mean _male_, what else would _only men_ mean in this context? Schools don't enroll other species, so what could they have been contrasting with? The first defininition of _man_ in the dictionary is _an adult human male_.
The Standard English Dictionary?  Is that figurative?
What evidence did your "someone else" give for thinking there wasn't an object?
What does your dictionary give as a meaning for *turnpike*?
_mill_ means _move around in a confused mass_. Why don't you think it means that?
On the basis that "benefit by happenstance, by birth, unsought-for" and "someone indirectly helping you" are much the same thing, maybe this is a duplicate of [*What English word can be used to describe someone indirectly helping you?*](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/238003/) (where the accepted answer is ***serendipity***).
More context would help.   Is it about politics?
Jimmy, do you have a link to the original source text for this? Or are you repeating this from something you heard?
Duh? Ambipedantic!
This is still unclear. Your title and text are at odds. The first leans towards cold/impersonal/autistic spectrum/sociopathic but the second is more about integrity/morality/principled. I think so far there are lots of suggestions but no indication if any are hotter or colder. Also, do you care about noun vs adjective, because if 'integrity' is a perfect noun, there's no exact adjective counterpart (though 'scrupulous', 'ethical' can still fit). So which ones so far are closer? (also check a thesaurus for more suggestions)
[This one](http://store.steampowered.com/app/355530/)? Also does not include the article... do you get my gist? Find an official page about the game and see what the creators of the game did... if "the" is part of the official game title, use it... otherwise, do not.
Did you mean *Bludgeon*? “I'll bludgeon you.” Though Josh is correct with the description you gave.
Either sound acceptable but do they mean exactly the same thing? *Certificate date* sounds like the date the certificate was written - which could be the same as *certification date*. But if there is a procedure whereby certificates are renewed (say annually) then will the date on any certificate necessarily be the same as that of original *certification*?
I can't back it up with links which seems to be a requirement here and don't know how it'll fly in British, but how about "companion"?  It can connote a "special friend" (or the word "girlfriend/boyfriend" for people in their 40+s), or (just) a dinner or travel companion; more familiar than an acquaintance.
Did you look it up in a dictionary?
Put away? When I'm at home and my husband wants to know where the scissors are, I tell him that I "put them away"... and he knows to find them in the office, with the other supplies or in the kitchen with the knives.
Even if there is a clear answer to this, how does it fall within 'English Language and Usage' other than being asked in English?
Since you're only supposed to provide information in a resume that is true and verifiable, I would **avoid** mentioning that some parts are "proven". It may give the suggestion that the rest of the resume is not. For the type of things you want to mention you could call them "recognition" or "acknowledgements", maybe?
Does the company give out anything other than **red** hats? If not, adding the color is silly. "I see you're wearing your Red Hat hat today". The only reason to repeat "red" is in the case someone has multiple Red Hat hats... a blue one, a green one and a red one, for example.
Have you really not come across figurative uses of *spineless*?
This is exactly the kind of situation in which a thesaurus shines. Look up swallowed (online or paper). Roget's is the best for abstract or metaphorical meanings (by metaphysical do you really mean philosophically?). In a poem you've written you'll have all sorts of weird constraints like meter and rhyme that are difficult to specify, but you also have the freedom to put things that are sort of 'out there' because they just sound right or are intentionally weird.
A good test is replacing with nearby situations to see if there is a rule. "My friends got their hair cut today" vs "My friends got their hairs cut today". Which one sounds better? And does that grammatical situation similar enough to apply to yours?
These don't sound right to me either (a native speaker). It could be that these are technical meanings. Trying to read between the lines, it seems like 'This chair is blue' should be _declarative_ (and being positive is only secondary). The first is declaring what _is_ and the second, the 'normative' sentence is saying what _should_ be. But this is speculation. Can you give more context where 'positive' and 'normative' are used in contrast? A sentence or paragraph from original sosurce?
Do you take issue with the portions of 'man' and 'male' specifically? Or are you just wanting variety?
Do you have any evidence to back up your assumption in the first paragraph? It seems to me (as a feminist) that you are perhaps constructing a strawman version of feminist ideas.
Do you know what time period the movement belonged (or belongs) to?
What do you mean -  the opposite of "x" is "not x" in mathematics?   In the common sense of "not", 6 is not 7, but 6 is not the opposite of 7, either.  So what EXACTLY do "opposite" and "not" mean in mathematics?
Okay, so my question for you, DC, is, would you ever use ***head***, apparently an OED-backed word? I probably never would. Knowing a technical or obscure word for something that in ordinarily life we call something else (*end*) sometimes serves little practical value. Reminds me of *[gore](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/249780/what-do-you-call-this-segment-of-road-between-the-lane-and-an-exit/249782#249782)*, which I would never use. Also @ermanen

Where do you get the idea that saying something longer will make it more correct?
I don't understand... how do you 'heed' a 'fallacy'? That makes it sound like you are trying to commit the fallacy as much as possible. Do you mean that you are 'aware' of the fallacy and are attempting to _not_ commit it? Anyway, many of your questions state this 'heeding' thing, but there's no need. Also, many of your questions where you state this, asking about why a word has the history of changes in meaning that it does, are just instances of semantic drift, figurative usage taking over the original literal. Are you just looking for 'missing (semantic) links'?
1) Don't use 'heed' and 'fallacy', they don't fit (as explained). 2) Don't use 'recognize' and 'fallacy'; they don't fit either (is a fallacy a friend?) 3) Don't use 'aware' and 'fallacy'; they fit great but there's no need to ever state "I am not doing X". Just don't do it. (and the title shows that you're not committing the fallacy 4) Now to substance: missing links are hard to find because they depend a lot on context for which the two different meanings both fit (like a comedy of errors). OED tends to list definitions in chronoogical order so def 2 might be an intermediate meaning..
I agree with @JuanCarlosOropeza - documents created by such anonymous users should be private by default (specifically to stop this kind of problem).  Instead of auto-saving it (well, you can cache it for the session at least), you need something that says "Sign in to link document to your account", and "Publish Anonymously?" (with maybe text about public changes.  It's much easier to make something public later, than to make it private.
This is hugely unclear: do you mean "Should I italicise the title of my own paper when I refer to it"? (Whatever the answer, please edit rather than putting information in comments). Also, is this really a question about English rather than style? If the latter, then "consult the stylebook favoured in your organization, or choose your preferred one".
It is the use of prepositions that most distinguishes American and British forms of the language. In America one appears *on a team*, or has eleven players *on our team*. In Britain we find ourselves *in the team for the match on Saturday.How many players are there **in** a rugby team?*
You seemed to have ignored "triviality" from the definition you quoted. Will that not do?
Something to throw into the pot: is _They were an amazing two days_ definitely _not_ idiomatic?  It's not setting off an alarm in my brain - if I read it in a piece of text, I wouldn't stumble over it.  (Both variants could be acceptable, of course.)
Is 'another'  the missing link? If 'only another seven day to go;' 'he lost another seven pounds;' are euphonious then perhaps that created a paradigm for **an** (adjective) (number) (plural noun of quantity). Or is it the same question under a different guise?
Can you explain why "item" is needed at all? Generally one simply says "create a (widget)" "create a (thing)". Perhaps show us an actual example?
1. What is the question? Is it about the word *surgery*, as the body of the question seems to suggest, or about a term for the MI Room? Can you be more specific?
2. Why not set aside the notion that *surgery* is about and only about "treatment by incision" which it is not?
Good edits. It is still unclear to me the context. Are you saying this sentence to someone else and you want to know how to say it better? Or are they saying it to you and you want to understand what they mean? In the first instance we can suggest alternatives and what they mean exactly. In the second, the sentence is given and can't be changed, and we would have to interpret the intention. Which is it?
Yohann, so do you want to know how to ask a question about aids, or if people come to you asking something about 'aids'? (the latter will be much more speculative)
Yohann, so you're saying you _want_ to be ambiguous in this imagined conversation where you use the word 'aids'?
Do you know the name of it in a different language? If you look it up on Wikipedia in your native language, you can look at the language options in the sidebar to see if there's a "view this page in English" link. That's how I translate a lot of unique stuff.
Are you sure in `against the outside` against is a negation? A ladder leans against the outside of the house. They hold against each other....
I would say that both are in use, but have you considered _page_? That's drawing a vague analogy with a website, and my subjective opinion is that it's a more user-friendly term (whereas _screen_ and _view_ are both technically driven, in my opinion).
What's your native language?
I'm not entirely sure what your question is, could you clarify? The term [etymological fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy) is used more commonly to refer to erroneously conflating the original meaning of a word with its modern meaning. It appears, instead, that you're referring to the phenomenon of words which appear similar, but aren't related to each other etymologically?
*Benefit* in what sense? How are you going to use it?
possible duplicate of [What do you call a window that is neither opaque nor transparent?](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/74780/what-do-you-call-a-window-that-is-neither-opaque-nor-transparent)
This makes no sense. You'll have to give a real world example of something that can be one or the other, and give a sentence with a blank in it where you want the wor to be. Do you want a single word for some glass that could be transparent or could be opaque (based on some change in manufacture process)? if so, then the single word is 'glass' and you then specify its 'opacity'. What is the purpose of this one word, to label a database column? Or is it a particular substane you have in mind that changes its opacity?
Orfby, no, I get that it isn't opaque and transparent at the same time. You're not talking about one object, you're talking about one kind of thing, of which there are varieties that are transparent and some that are opaque (and some in between I guess). What I don't get is that you're requesting a single word to describe that situation. When two words suffice, eg, either 'opaque glass' or 'transparent glass'. Are you looking for a word '____ glass' that includes both situations? like 'glass with varying levels of opacity'? If so, what makes a single word so necessary?
Unfortunately the edits have gone round in a circle. A single word that can describe both something opaque and something transparent (the two being opposites) and also something in between? *Existent*.
Let's suppose that such a word existed and you asked a sales representative, "Is this thing I want to buy, *conflustulent*?"  and suppose the sale rep says, "Yes, it is."  What knowledge have you gained?
Orfby, reading between the lines, I sense that you may be a non-native speaker of English. If so, is there a term for this in your native language? If not, you probably need to explain further the nuance of this word. Also, do you have an example sentence where this word would fit?
@Orfby is your word to transparent/opaque similar to what size is to big/small?
In which country are you being taught this?
I feel "Next year I complete the final year of my program" is more presumptuous, leaving nothing to chance or change of plans. If you want the second variant to be less presumptuous, then how about "As per current progress (or schedule), I will complete the final year of my program next year" or "I am expecting to complete the final year of my program next year" ?

I think this question is probably better-suited for http://writers.stackexchange.com, where style-guide-based questions are explicitly [on-topic](http://meta.writers.stackexchange.com/questions/875/writers-se-on-topic-summary); here they are generally considered [off-topic](http://meta.english.stackexchange.com/questions/273/what-questions-are-on-topic-and-off-topic-here).  (I know you said you couldn't find it in MLA, but the question could be considered "is there a style guide that addresses this, and if so, what does it say?".)
If I understand your edit you are looking for a word that explicitly excludes  dialogue or monologue. Is that correct?
For one thing, "I like to put the milk in first" has the first person in reference, the alternative does not. What do you think?
Seems almost like this might get more informed answers on the Philosophy Stack Exchange -- although it pretty clearly seems on topic here. Which part is more important, the "predetermined" or the "as if free will didn't exist" part? There are arguments that predetermination and free will are not incompatible.
I'm wondering what might be the reason for such word problems. I see no practical use for it. Are those questions from a test book or something similar?
What's wrong with *emotionally charged*?
Do you mean the enforced waiting period between sessions of sex while one or both partners physically recovers to be ready for the next bout - or do you mean the periods which most couples have when they decide to do something else for a while instead of having sex?
If it was a quantity of liquid could it have been a drizzle?
All I can find is "opposite vector" or "negative vector". Is it something other than that?
Any reason "query" is unsuitable? I realise it has a specific technical meaning in the context of databases (e.g. SQL), but it seems it can also be used less formally to achieve the same broader (less technically specific) meaning.
@nomad I have never heard of this protocol before. Is it something unique to the AMA or is it a general practice across medicine everywhere?
I am guessing that you want to design a user interface. If so then an existing convention may help you. I am not sure but you could try http://ux.stackexchange.com/ or even http://stackoverflow.com/ ?
Are we suddenly seeing a dozen? or more? sailing in the clear blue sky?
I guess it causes much *inconvenience*. Is that too general for your case?
Seriously, we're you puzzled by the intentionally blank thing or are you just testing out material that will make you the next Jerry Seinfeld?
At one point you say you consider ***archaic*** to mean "out of place (due to it being too old)", but this might cause confusion if you (or others posting here) aren't clear and consistent about what exactly "too old" means. Too old for a current reader? For a professor of English born in the 19th century, writing a book almost 80 years ago? Too old to be consistent with the general patterns of speech and narrative style in the books themselves? *Archaic* by default has the first of those referents, but *anachronistic* could quite naturally apply to any of them.
It is too technical for me. You see, we need a context to deal with the ambiguity and I don't understand the context. Is there such a thing as a "geometry pointer"? In which case, I'd put those two together first. Or is there such a thing as "valid geometry", to which you have a pointer? We use context usually to sort this out.
The OED has "applesauce" used in this way back to 1925.  So are you asking about what to call a word (other than "applesauce") used for the first time in a new sense?
What research have you done?
You think that's unfair?  Have you read *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies*?
Maybe Missile Alert?
Are these gerunds?  What year (approx) and whose inspiration changed them from being participles? Please.
Given other clauses in IRC:6-2014, this would be inconsistent. Could you please elaborate on this? In the pictures following the first occurrence of your text (my copy says 1.22m btw) the shown 1.200 meters is consistent with the text. Which other clauses do you think contradict your reading of this line?
Can you link to the exact 'premature judgement' definition that you're referring to (for prejudicial)?
Interesting! You have a problem with "ponderousness"? You mean, you ponder...a lot? Or, you make yourself sound too complex?
It will depend on lot on the source language of the word. Germanic prefixes, Latin prefixes and Greek prefixes all are different, and work differently. Just to clarify, you want a way to separate prefixes from roots based on the spelling of a word?
Is that actually what the saying means? I take it to be more along the lines of "the baker never buys _his own_ bread" because he knows what's in it.
Just seeing the title - before clicking through to read the full question - the first thing that came to mind was "the shoemaker's children go barefoot", which means that after you've done your job all day for other people you don't want to do it at home too. (In your mechanic example, I suppose it would be "the mechanic's car is always broken down.")  I realize it's not what you're looking for, but now I'm curious: how many proverbs like this - with similar setups but completely different conclusions - are there?
Well, even in the first sentence, "the body" could be understood as referring to the entire body, including the brain. The brain's individual parts certainly send signals to different parts of the brain. Also, just to clarify, you want two single words: one for "the body including the brain," and another single word for "the body absent the brain," right?
Sorry, what is the question? The extract assigns a gender to the form (likely because physical form can indicate gender), and yes the 'they' represents her and the form (it could represent the coin too, however having read the book, the function of push would send the coin in the opposite direction rather than 'with' her).
ADHD tag? lol. Anyways, what's the context? I'd like to know what you needed that tag for, please.
If it's a document, what difference does it make how it's transmitted?
Exactly what part of that are you having trouble with? Also, you might be better off on our sister site, [ell.se] in the future.
*Method? Approach? Model*? What *is* a "Jacobian Matrix Pattern"? And why not just call it a, well, *pattern*? You listed a few words that don't work, but forgot to specify what it is that you are after. It's hard to tell you how to best express something without knowing what it is you are trying to express.
Is there a reason this is cross posted on both ELU and ELL? One of them needs to be removed as cross posting is strongly discouraged.
I have been working as a freelance for the last 5 years. I am really interested about writing and submitting articles about freelancing. How can I do it here? Is there any option like Guest Post?
Sounds like you are trying to tell someone which Chinese characters to use for certain pinyin names, where the latter are used without pinyin accents. And just what is reversed here - do you mean only to say that Lin is the last (i.e., family) name and Li-Mei is the first (given) name?
This goes to the heart of a philosophical issue. Is the *mind* active or re-active?  *Mind on body* and *body on mind* amount to the same thing, but infer different means by which it got there.
Do you remember the name of the book in which the phrase occurred?
You are setting a puzzle to which you know the answer?  Fair enough.
Welcome to EL&U. Have you consulted a thesaurus? You'll also have to explain why *I am curious about you* sounds "awful." I encourage you to take the [site tour](http://english.stackexchange.com/tour) and review the [help center](http://english.stackexchange.com/help) for a better understanding of how this site operates.
Are you comfortable ***with*** the idiomatic use of prepositions?
Is it "myself," the reflexive pronoun, that you're concerned with?
*formal/informal interface*? Probably too technical for this site.  Objective-C calls a collection of methods that can be implemented by other classes outside inheritance specifically a *protocol*, which only disambiguates if the language strictly defines what it means.
Is this a  homework assignment?
Does it have to be the internet?
What situation in logic would you get where the outcome of an operation was neither success nor fail?  Unless it was still pending, or resulted in an error?
My guess is that they are from five different sources.  #4 is probably from a political rival of William Pitt the Elder (1708 - 1778) or William Pitt the Younger (1759 - 1806) and means that Pitt thinks he is God.  Why has no one proposed closing this question?  I am very tolerant, but this seems too much like being asked to do homework.
This wouldn't be about electron holes would it?
Sorry I don't get why *can, have, do* etc are exceptions? The only exception here is *BE*. The only reason to say that a modal such as *can* is different is perhaps just because they cannot be proven to have a *base* form.
It should be noted that the Bible verse you quote is itself an English translation from the original Greek. Are you sure that your "actual source" is a more accurate translation than your "mis-quoted" version?
What is the name of the action that rasing a hand gesture for making fun? What is the name of the writing that putting words like that for making question? (And who is rasing anyway?)
How is that an “I love you” gesture? Never heard of it, nor seen it.
Is this a computer/web program or something static? A program should be able to handle putting the actual dates in the columns (which removes the problems of weird naming conventions).  With something static, I'd probably prefer Today/Yesterday/Last Week/Week Before Last/Last Month/Month Before Last. But I think it'll always be clunky.
Hoisted by his own petard?
Please supply source attributions for those citations.  Why would *soppy* be restricted to Britain?  Also, do you consider *soppy* and *sappy* as meaning two different things?
Do you mean from outer-space? If so, have you considered extraterrestrial?
How are those sentences, even with *[word]* replaced by the word you seek?
Are you looking for the pronunciation or for the dictionary entry in the U.S. That corresponds to the British 'teatime'?
What is the relationship between the writer, the little kid, and the intended recipient of the expressed sentiment?  There are very few   situations in which ***that*** *little kid* would make sense.
Even "Player1?" should do.

I don't speak German, but it is possible that this idiom is equivalent to "Damned if you do, damned if you don't"?
Both example sentences are punctuated correctly. And do not look weird in the least. Also, what's this to do with grammar? This has nothing at all to do with grammar.
*Approach? Strategy? Logic?*
Have you thought of asking your divorce lawyer?
@sooeithdk In what way do you perceive the impression to be different?
Don’t you think that anyone who find *low man of the totem pole* offensive would similarly find anything expressing the same sentiment equally offensive?
What's wrong with *read*? I am currently reading Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mocking Bird*. That is a work of fiction.
So if you plan to see someone tomorrow, you say you'll see them in two days not one? English doesn't normally work that way, although this is the confusion that led to penal sentences of a year and a day. Cultural differences are common here; for example in English two weeks is a fortnight (14 days) yet in Spanish it is a quincena (15 days) for the same period.
We can also just use the absolute dates:  "I'll meet you on the 8th" which refers to the day of the month. @Lavya, your example is a little ambiguous.  if today was July 16th and a Sunday and you wanted to meet someone on Tuesday the 18th would you say "the 18th day from today" or would you say, "the 2nd day from today" or would you say, "the 3rd day from today"?
In the on-line dictionary reference you supplied, it is stated to be a *noun*. But in none of the three example sentences it gives is it used as a noun. Are you able to supply some more examples?
Can you give more details about the nuances of the word you are seeking? Diminutive, child-talk, euphemism sure. But is it a silly word or a misdirection. Is it old-fashioned or new? (I am not BrE but) What's wrong with 'tuppence'? 'fanny'? 'coochie'?
@WS2 ?? I couldn't find anything on 'lulu' or anything in that link that justifies 'honolulu penny' having a special meaning. It mentions it at the end but doesn't explain a thing. What do 'lulu' and 'honolulu penny' mean and why?
@WS2 Wait... are you saying that 'lulu' (or the longer phrase) is like an English version of snippa? Exactly the thing you are asking about?
Regardless if historical background, this question is still interesting - "are you A?" followed by "no I'm B", where B is a subset of A, is a pattern I've seen with places/nationalities ("I'm not European, I'm English") as well as professional specialties.
If you agree that "*word* is not well enough defined to allow such precise counting", how would it be possible to distinguish 'ice cream' from 'tomato sauce'?
The inclusion of the state name implies that it is (or could be) restrictive. Why include it if not? In the case of "New York", the fully qualified name also helps to disambiguate the city from the state - if you wrote something about New York it may not be clear that you were not referring to the state.
Can you cite any evidence that ***Employe*** even has any *currency* (let alone *credibility*)?
What was wrong with *alkaline*?
Just say alkaline.  But what do you mean by "alkaline heavy water"?  "Heavy water" is D2O.  Water is H2O.  The D is deuterium, that is, heavy hydrogen, with one proton and one neutron in its nucleus.  (H has one proton in its nucleus.)   The pH of the water and the isotopic composition of the water are two entirely different things.  As for  alkalitic or alkalinic, no, simply no.
This question is off-topic here because it has nothing to do with English. The joke would be exactly the same in every other language. If you don't get it in English, that's not because of English but because you just don't get it. Translate it word for word into your mother tongue, and you'd still not get it. (If you *did* translate it word for word into your mother tongue and *did* get it, then what exactly is your question?)
First off, "it's" is not a verb. Secondly, if it seems fine here, then what is your question? Why do you think it's not fine if you think it's fine? Please elaborate. Oh, and read up on the *dummy it* in the linked question.
Not all papers are structured in the same way, so I doubt there is a single definitive answer across all of English. What do comparable papers in your field use? At least, can you provide a more concrete, real-life example?
Maybe you can add more for clarity. What are other section headings in your paper? Is this a subsection to the introduction or definition of terms?
... Are you sure you don't mean something like "Winning at Wimbledon was a waltz for Venus"?... "Venus" in this case referring to Venus Williams, the tennis player? Because "was a waltz" does definitely mean "it was easy".
*Component* and *part* are perfectly fine. *Piece* is too generic. *Fragment* does not really work. *Modification* does not work at all. But why not say *target*? When you can target a creature in various different places and destroy the targets independently, then well, they are *targets*.

Why does a waiter sometimes say *Thank you* as he leaves your table after taking your order? Partly because he's in a "service" role, and saying *Thank you* is deferential/polite. And partly because *you're helping him to do his job* - which is good for him, because if he doesn't do his job he won't get any job satisfaction (and probably won't get *paid* either! :)
Perfectly fine English. Do state which verb you think he should have used instead. What other options do we even have? You have to be specific what it is you think is wrong, why you think so, what alternatives you are considering, and why exactly they are any better. Otherwise the question is rather pointless. If you just say "*I have a red car* doesn't sound correct to me" and leave it at that, then people *will* fall over themselves finding all kinds of problems with it. You will learn that every single word in it is in the wrong place, spelled incorrectly, and generally not even English.
middle-range or senior executive level ?
As the top answer on the linked question indicates, the relevant "rule" is a piece of pedantic poppycock that's always been either unknown to or ignored by the vast majority of native speakers. But in the case of, say, *calories*, you can tell they're always countable because we never say *How much calorie(s) does this cake contain?* - it's always *How **many** calories?*
If by that you mean you want to know whether *How much calories is in this cake?* is "valid" or not, I suggest that the question is either Too Basic, or belongs on [English Language Learners](http://ell.stackexchange.com/).
If *this* specific case deserves its own answer, where would we draw the line? You imply we should also accept separate questions asking about *How much ounces / inches / dollars does this weigh / measure / cost?*
What's wrong with sender?
I'm having trouble understanding your question, but I may be one of those people who resets something by setting it again. My alarm is set to 7:35am and once it goes off in the morning, I reset it to 8:00am; when night comes around, I reset it again to 7:35am (repeat until dead). Is this what you're looking for?
You started to lose me at "burden of."  Could you re-write your question, please, with very short, simple sentence structures?  Your writing style is so unusual, I need simplicity to try to follow what you're trying to say.
How about "functionally equivalent"?  Two versions of XML might differ in areas that don't affect the output of  a rendering agent.  They thus wouldn't be identical, but would be functionally equivalent.

It doesn't make much sense to understand it as ***invisible***.

Why use conceptualisation when concept will do?
What makes you think 1. is wrong?
Welcome to EL&U. Can you narrow down your question at all? There are probably hundreds of ways to ask, from *Sorry, who's this?* to *And with whom may I say I have the pleasure of speaking?* A simple web search on "telephone etiquette" should turn up an ample number of acceptable options. As initially presented, I think this question is either too broad, too opinion-based, or too-lacking in preliminary research to be answerable here.
Why not use ***generate*** like you did in your question?  *drawing* should focus on the mechanics of putting ink on paper.  *plotting* focuses on placing points on a graph.
_He referenced 3.2.11 as specific example_ What is 3.2.11? Can you quote it in your question?
I found that same document [here](http://cflc.xmu.edu.cn/linli/resources/MLA/MLA_04.pdf). Problem is, your example sentences here are not addressing that issue. Something like this would be more fitting: _Do you think the last line of the movie should be "Let's get out of here"?_ The style guide recommends putting the question mark **outside** the quotes because the question mark goes with the "Do you think..." part, and not "Let's get out of here." If the character was asking a question instead, it would be different: _Do you think the last line should be "Should we get out of here?"_
Are you _quoting_ characters or writing _dialog_? If it's dialog, the the only rule you need to follow is that it's a complete sentence. Of your examples, #5 would be the only one incorrect, as you don't need the exclamation point in the middle of your sentence (just a period; the "he exclaimed" _is_ the exclamation point).
What's wrong with 'no overlap'?
_Relationship between mother and children_?
Where does he say "we shouldn't be indifferent"?
Where did you get the **1ms** notation from? I'm not familiar with it, and Google Books has no instances of those three characters in close proximity to either **1st** or **first person masculine singular**. But you must have got it from *somewhere, so presumably that's the place to look for other forms.
Are you referring to **"prophetic"** - as in: ***"Big Brother is watching you"***?
Package quantity?
Maybe it would be helpful to clarify the difference to find a suitable expression. Are A and B molecules? What meaning should your sentence convey? Does A have one more/less atom then B, is one atom substituted by a different element? The purpose of your sentence is not quite clear.
How do you vote on a comment?  Many comments I see best all the answers.  I'd click endure but I don't seem to have those magic powers yet (and if they're awarded, I'll probably never obtain)
If *inculpate* is too Latinate for you, the OED also has *guilt* as an obsolete verb, with a 1553 citation of “Hath he then guilted himself of murder?”
Perhaps I'm not understanding your question. Two puzzles stand out: (1) is the change from "Lucy realized she had ...." to "Lucy realized she found ...." material to the question? and (2) in the comments, you suggest that substituting or being able to substitute 'to condemn' is necessary--doesn't that substitution in itself answer your question: "Lucy realized she had proof to [or, 'that would'] condemn Robert [for the murders]."?
So it's a record?
What are you asking about?  Whether it's OK to use the word "purchase" for a subscription?
Does "commissioned" work for you?
Fine is just... fine. It may not have such a positive connotation as you want to convey. If the results are "fine", I expect them to be "OK" but not "great". _Great_ could be an alternative?

Are we *in* love and willing to do anything for it, or *looking* for love and willing to do anything for it?
Am I to understand that the other party will be free to choose how much and in what manner to repay to you your share of the project? Quite apart from the correct English form it does seem as if you are putting a great deal of trust in them. Have I interpreted the position correctly? I am also a little confused by your use of *ethics*. How do they enter into the matter? Clearly honouring trust is a matter of ethics, but I don't think I have grasped the exact picture.
**bungalow** may be?
Given that you want a "catch-all", what have you got against "harvester"?

Where do you get 'a sharp rise after 1500' from? The ngram starts in 1700. Also ngram has very spotty collection of texts from before 1800, so inferences from that earlier time will be very questionable.
At first I thought you meant something that did the intended job but not in the most elegant way (and which was therefore perhaps "sub-optimal), but now it sounds like you mean that the code is internally consistent and without bugs, but not "working" in the sense of answering the right question.  I guess you don't want to call it "bugless"?

Tvtopes says Wikipedia says it's called a "mind rhyme." I haven't done research but I'd lazily assume that the existence of these multi-word phrases means that no single word for this phenomenon exists yet. By the way, do you want a single word, or is a phrase also fine? If you want one word, edit your question to tag it with "single-word-requests"; if a phrase is OK, tag with both "single-word-requests" and "phrase-requests." http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki Main/SubvertedRhymeEveryOccasion

Did you mean *content* as regards that which is contained in something? Or did you mean *content* meaning *in a state of peaceful happiness* - which is of course already an adjective? If you are talking about the latter, the adverb would be *contentedly*. But if we are discussing *the contents of a box*, I am afraid that it doesn't have inflections. You will need to use things like *content specific, content regarding, content determined, content depending etc*.
filtering data involves throwing out samples you've collected.  I assume you are talking about just collecting samples from a "random?" subset of the population?

Also, do you mind if I critique the premise? why do you need to put this information in the parameter name? Won't it be obvious from the way the program is set up? And if not, can't it just give an error message if an out-of-bounds value is somehow put in?
These are two separate questions about English usage, even though they relate to the same quotation. For the meaning of "albeit," what do you not understand? What did you find when you looked the word up in a dictionary or searched this site for it?
Interesting question... a bit off topic, but I'm curious as to why you're creating that as a column. Wouldn't that just be more effort to normalize the data?
OK. Wanting to get more facts is perfectly fine! It's just that I have learned, based on my own experience in this community, that it's important to "show your research" when asking a question, especially if you already know part of the answer. Do you mind if I edit your question to add both the Wiktionary link, and your reason for wanting more information?
A comma after? Do you mean before, such as an Oxford comma?
Can you please explain why you think it isn't a compound word?

Does it have anything to do with class?  I remember an episode of "Upstairs, Downstairs" in which Belgian refugees (WWI)  taken on as part of staff at Eaton Place asked for coffee, and the Downstairs staff were outraged.  Coffee was for Upstairs, tea was for Downstairs.
What exactly is your specific context? We're likely to speak of *expediting* a potentially long, drawn-out process (such as applying for certain official documents in certain countries). But you'd probably *accelerate* something like the proving of bread dough using yeast, if it was taking too long. Or you might *quicken* your pace if you're not walking fast enough to reach the station before the train leaves. I think the *precise* context is important, since most people probably wouldn't consider those three words idiomatically equivalent and interchangeable in those three contexts.
I am somewhat puzzled by your question: "could that third line end with a comma?" There is no comma in the poem as it stands. So the answer is no: if you put one in, you've made it a different poem. "Not all your light tongues talking aloud could be profound" has no need of a comma, and talking aloud is not really parenthetical. As Araucaria and I have said, the subject is "not all your light tongues talking aloud". If you look up all the questions about comma usage on this site, you will realise that it is very often impossible to be categorical about the matter.
And did it perhaps predate the sense of timber? And did the timber sense perhaps derive from the plod sense?
OP: Do you have the same question about *get on/in the bus/plane*? From where I sit, both *on* and *in* can be used in these cases, though they can have slightly different connotations. I would probably always say *get on the train* but I might say, in some contexts *get in the train car*. It's all about whether you are thinking of the destination as a container, IMO. We pretty much always say *get in the car* (container), and *get on the train* (not a single container, but as @Rathony says, a conveyance), but we can say both *get in the plane* and *get on the plane*.
So you're saying a line can have a constant radius other than the infinite, under its mathematical definition?  And a curve would always have a variable radius?  Sounds like there's a very good reason to use the term 'straight line'.
The example 'play' vs. 'abstemious' is a good one as it highlights some problems with this question. One of those words is easier to pronounce and spell than the other, but has many more possible usages and meanings. What do you mean by 'learning a word'?
@Radi - So you'll agree that learning the meaning(s) of 'play' is a much harder task  than learning the meaning(s) of 'abstemious'? I apologise then, because I assumed you meant the opposite.

By which definition? As Wikipedia mentions, in linguistic terminology even a single word can be a phrase; so by the linguistic definition "Albert," "Isadora," "Duncan," "Lord of the Rings" etc. are all noun phrases.
OK. Can you give an example of how you'd use the word "phrase" to refer to these in everyday speech? It doesn't seem a very likely situation to me.
With the first one, you do not need the definite article. The idiom is *...at present*. Otherwise they are both fine. Incidentally by *PLC* do you mean *Public Limited Company*? If so I would suggest the sentences need to be worded slightly differently.
What made you choose 'A'? (I'm not being obstructive, it would help us understand your current reading of the passage).
okay, let me ask if you believe S & N thought **all** writers had this calling, and felt this duty? Doesn't the text suggest it applied to only a "few"?
Do you mean a one or two words expression for "online communities that are intolerant to criticism" ? something like "one-track thinking community" or **sectarian** community.
I don't understand how "hugbox" is ableist. Is hugging associated with disabled people in some way?
@fluffy I'd never heard of that. Is it possible that the two meanings developed independently?
Sian Ede, right?  How does mild delight in detritus contradict perfect images?  Suppose she'd said "fervid despair in detritus aligns with flawed images"?  Would that make any more or less sense?  You won't be right until you realize this stuff has no discernible meaning.
I hope you don't think my ongoing comments about Sian Ede's writing are in any way a criticism of your questions.  But I'm afraid you're incorrect about two things.  The first is that Ede is being intentionally ambiguous.  She's not; she's thinks she's being illuminating.  The second is that native speakers find it easy to identify such nonsense writing.  Many can't, especially those who labor in the fields of post-modernism -- lit crit, social studies, cultural studies, etc.  Look up "Alan Sokal *Social Text*"  I hope you don't mind my asking, but why are you reading this?
*Journeyman. Well-informed. Well-read. Pre-informed. Done their homework.* Or really a hundred others. You can't think of anything, at all?
Interesting question! It seems wrong to me as well. It vaguely reminds me of some similar word in French, but I can't remember which specifically. Can you tell us any more about the person who disagrees with you?
So, what, this is the only question you've asked here for which you haven't accepted an answer? What's up with that?
History is the witness that testifies for passing of time sounds wrong to me, and I'm a native speaker. "Passing" seems to be missing an article. Are you sure option b was not "testifies for **the**"?
*"What is emitted from the divine, though it be only like the reflection from the fire, still has the divine reality in itself, and one might almost ask what were the fire without glow, the sun without light, or the Creator without the creature?"* -- [Max Müller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_M%C3%BCller)
Could you clarify - does person A *know* what B thinks? or are they [deluded](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/deluded)?
Huh? There is no occurrence of *both* or *each* in any of those examples.
It would be helpful if you could tell us what options you've considered and rejected. For example, have you looked for synonyms of *persecute*?
Without context, this is almost impossible. What do you mean by *rich* - complex? rewarding? opulent?
Are there languages that aren't context dependent?
@Some_Guy What have I said that would make you think not?
*"By"* can have lots of meanings, but many online dictionaries and resources list the relevant one. Which ones have you looked at?
Are you asking what a rhetorical question is called?
In the episode of _Scrubs_ titled "My New Game,"Turk has a new attending who has the habit of speaking by asking a question and immediately answering it, no matter the situation (Negative:  Do I want you to be on time, Dr. Turk? Yes I do. Am I going to remember this? Of course I am." Positive: "Do I think you did great? Yes I do!").  They simply refer to this as being a "question talker," though it's not quite the level of rhetoric you're asking about.
Interesting. Do you have any links to people pronouncing these words in the way you describe (for example, on Forvo)?

@macraf - As far as I can tell, your question (as edited) boils down to "Is *copywriting* a noun?" Is that right?
1) Wikipedia is knowlingly a work in progress. Using 'copyrightings' as a replacement for 'copies' is wrong. Maybe wikipedia could be changed to reflect that. 2) "Circulating on the internet"? do you have examples?
@macraf Sorry, I thought we had already established it is wrong usage. Then you ask if a copied description (not actual usage, just the usage described by wikipedia) and copied many times, you're still asking if that means it is OK usage? That sounds like you trust repetition on the internet as truth, rather than what we're telling you here.
I have to admit, I'm having trouble figuring out what you want to know. What are you really asking? Can you sum it up in a single sentence?
Okay in whose opinion? Yes, some of us may say their pet passed away. And others of us will inadvertently roll our eyes upon hearing it.
Can you tell us the conversation between you or what were you doing at the time of speaking?
I think the rule is 'light at the beginning of a syllable; dark at the end'. What is the IPA and features of dark vs light?
So I guess that means token frequency? For example, do you want "[a rose is a rose is a rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type–token_distinction)" to count as having 2 instances of /z/ (one in "rose," one in "is") or 5 (in *rose, is, rose, is,* and *rose*)?

Do you know of a language that has such a word? If so it would be delightful to know about it.
It sounds a bit odd to me, too, but as an American I would not be entirely surprised to hear a British person omit "have" or "see."  Can you link to the example?
Why does the word need to apply to women in particular? There are men who behave like this.
So... because you don't trust people on the Internet, you ask other people on the Internet? Whatever floats your boat. Luckily in my capacity as a person on the Internet I can assure you that *any English word at all* can be used as a verb.
On ELL, the processes of word-formation in English should be part of the agenda. Assuming the request is frivolous should not be part of the agenda. Even supposing the request is frivolous, the opportunity to teach the learner something about English word-formation would better not be passed up. Should we punt questions like this back at ELL? I don't mean to start the 30 Years War.

I'm afraid this may be closed as an even broader question than the one you linked to. Unless you provide a specific example and/or more context, that is. Why not find a script to the episode you watched and link to it?
Maybe it's *metered verse*?
No, it is not the same. But *on* definitely doesn't sound quite right. But I would be more concerned about your use of the term *low level* to mean *the structure*. I would not have known what *low level* meant, had you said that to me. Why didn't you say *structure*?

Native speakers tend to say *search for food* because no native speaker ever really says *seek food* in 2015. "I'm famished. I seek food!" wut? ~ Answer `E`: *foraging for* [food]. Cultivation is the basis of modern human society and the leading reason we have so much leisure time (yea, I used to fail a lot of tests this way). According to Ngrams, "SearchING for food" and "foraging for food" are on their way up. "Seek [anything]" is on its way down.

As I understand, OP is asking for a name of a food that comes from an ingredient having an uncountable mass noun-name, which is then separated and processed. During processing it changes its name. But it cannot be physically recombined into a mass, though its name inherits mass noun-quality of the original ingredient. Now the question is: if you buy a bread for toasting (consisting of 10 slices), toast them, and put back into the same package - what the result would be called? If you called it "toast" than it means, that toast has a physical mass form. If "10 slices of toasted bread" - not.
So *summer* only ever refers to astronomical or meteorological summer elsewhere? How sad to live in such a literal-minded place as Not-America sounds like, and how difficult it must be to keep track of when summer begins and ends in each locale. :)
AFAIK, in the US "*over the summer*" always refers to a time period in the summer, whether or not the context is a break from school. I don't know anyone who would use such an expression to refer to such a school break in the winter, for instance. Can you point to a reference that gave you this idea?
The answer to the question "*Do Americans have their own unique way of referring to 'the summer'?*" is **no**, AFAICT. You should provide some information about what makes you think the answer might be yes. IOW, why the question?
There is no *Why*. Why is information a count noun in Italian? Why is news a count noun in Italian? Different strokes for different folks..

Are you only looking for instances where the compound word is derived from the two inferred constituents? Presumably, if you are demonstrating the ability for the reader/listener to automatically disambiguate based on context, good examples could be words comprising parts whose meanings were potentially ambiguous for many reasons - e.g. spelling, pronunciation - despite having distinct etymologies. An example could be "sorbet". When spoken, this could be identical or nearly identical to "sore bay", and its correct interpretation would still illustrate your point.

But how far removed does the literal meaning have to be? For instance, *blue chip* originally referred to gambling tokens that were literally colored blue, but few people who invest in *blue chips* nowadays would make that connection. If it's not a stock, it's a snack made from [blue corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_corn). Similarly, the *Jerusalem artichoke* certainly has nothing to do with Jerusalem, and it is the root that is eaten and not the flowers as with a regular artichoke. The foliage is very vaguely similar, but consumers would not know how the foliage of either looks.

I think the premise of the question is flawed.  *taste*, as given in the examples, is always a countable noun.   "*popular taste*" is not an uncountable noun, it is one instance of all the possible tastes that are out there.     *Milk*, as a concrete noun for something that comes in both continuous amounts (uncountable) and discrete types (countable) has a clear reason for uncountable and countable versions.   Is there a better abstract noun example than *taste*?

Okay, so how would you say in Swedish, "Is that giraffe male or female?" and "Is that human male or female?"
I must apologize for RegDwigнt's behavior, it's very uncouth. Now. To the best of my understanding, "man" doesn't mean "male" in Swedish: it means "man." And "kvinna" isn't "female": it's "woman." As for the other thing: "he-giraffe or she-giraffe." There are loads of different words in English to specify a creature's gender that way. She-wolf, bull (male elephant), bitch (female dog), etc, etc. From your translation I can only assume that the words "male" and "female" don't even exist in Swedish. Doubtful, that. Is it true? What about masculine/feminine? Think about it and get back to me.

Why do you call it a "proverb"? [(a short popular saying, usually of unknown and **ancient** origin)](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/proverb) The earliest written instance I can find is [1998](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=%22never+ask+a+barber+if+he+thinks+you+need+a+haircut%22#q=%22never+ask+a+barber+if+he+thinks+you+need+a+haircut%22&tbm=bks&t  cdr:1,cd_min:1900,cd_max:1999). But anyone who's never heard it before (such as me) would obviously understand the intended meaning, even though it has negligible currency and even less history.
The fact that you've chosen to frame your context as *A is xxxx **for** B* unnecessarily precludes many possibilities (including *infatuated*, since that takes ***with***, not ***for***). But as you so rightly point out, the actual context in no way implies a "short-lived" emotion. How are we supposed to guess what *other* semantic constraints you might have arbitrarily decided you want to impose on the target word, if you don't tell us, and they're not implicit in the cited context?
Would you accept *manifestation*?
Your *monitor* probably doesn't allow adjustment of ***resolution***, for example. But in principle is that another one of the video attribute adjustments you want included?

Who says the preference for heavier women might be a ***subconscious** preference?* Even in Western societies, where people are far more likely to be morbidly obese than starving, you'll often hear people saying that they like their women/men "with a bit of meat on 'em", for example. Given that by definition ***memes*** are transmitted through ***culture***, I doubt there would be many (if any) that get replicated without people even being aware of them.

Well, it lists a bunch of other words spelled with "e" in modern British English that originally had one of the Ancient Greek diphthongs oi/ai, so I don't understand the reason for your update. There's  *aenigma*, *oeconomics* (and all other words with the *eco-* prefix); there's optionally *encyclopaedia, homoeopathy, chamaeleon*. Why doesn't this answer your question; do you want a comprehensive list?

@Kyle But we still *dial* telephone numbers, after hearing a *dialling tone*. And we still tune in to radio and TV stations. Indeed there are scores of these things - ships still *sail* the oceans, even super-tankers of  500,000 tonnes. So why not an online *newspaper*?
@Kyle I'd say *A newspaper only available online*. The point surely is that things like *The Daily Beast* and *The Huffington Post* include in their names elements which associate them with traditional newspapers - *daily*, *post*. It must therefore be their proprietors' wishes to have them regarded as newspapers. So why not call them that?

I assume you are at least somewhat finished with your first calendar program. If I'm correct, then how can you still be working on it at the same time you're working on the new, complex system. I'm confused. "Concurrent" would mean you're working on both programs at the same time. Why not simply start the next sentence with, "Two years on, I am working . . ."? Or, if you want to provide a contrast between the two programs, you could say, "Building on the success of my first program, I am now designing a complex universal calendar system." The words "simple" & "complex" provide u with contrast.
Regarding your last question: "If I were to play" sounds much more unlikely than "If I played". The same applies to more complex tenses: "If I had played" sounds more likely than "If I were to have played". But I've got the feeling you already knew that, so what do you mean with "why would there be any difference"? After all, you just mentioned two (I'd say significant) ones: formality and emphasis (by emphasis, I presume you mean likelyhood).

Many people have difficulty making small talk.  Others chatter all the time, and say nothing; in small doses, they are amusing.  As for the word:  shy?  self-conscious?  Serious-minded?   Such people can become very interesting when the right topic is introduced.
Are you asking whether the phrase carries the same meaning in English?

It's hyphenated, but how about: "service-provider"?
Why are you mixing workers and companies here? All employees work for a company so you could always put a company name there (for sole- proprietors you can put the person’s name as the company name) OR the other way is to always put the employee’s name regardless of which company they work for- it that’s what’s important.  If it’s a matter of your own eemployees names or subcontracting the work out, then you can out your own company name when work is being performed by your employees.
Who says Vendor refers to only companies? It can mean both companies and individuals. The ice-cream truck owner who has set shop adjacent to the market road would be an individual vendor. Baskin&Robbins would be a multi-national vendor. I'd go with vendor. More like `public class Vendor`! ;)
Why do people spend so much time searching for The Perfect Class Name? You could call the class Lemonade and it'd work just as well.
It looks as if you are really asking "Please name this class in my program", and since we know no spaces are allowed, you want one word. But how about using camelCase for something like "servProv"? No spaces, short, perhaps even memorable.
If I had cared to post an *answer* rather than a *comment*, I would have done so. You're welcome to post a comment yourself explaining why *away with the fairies* either *is* or *isn't* the kind of term you're looking for, and you or anyone else is welcome to Copy&Paste it into an actual answer. Personally, I'd say there's a fair "metaphorical distance" between, say, *fumbling in the dark/clutching at straws* and *missing big/being way off-beam*. But do you actually care which end of that spectrum people pick up on?
Not wishing to be awkward, I don't see what the first example is getting at. I could point out out that you *can't* actually say "your" ***or*** "you're", because in speech they're unavoidably identical, but is that what you're getting at? That's to say - is the point of the example to show someone saying something "totally and demonstrably incorrect"? The second example seems to be in that general area.

This is a good question and I would have up-voted it but for the fact that both your questions contain grammatical errors.

I don't know why so many people sincerely trying to learn English use poorly written, pompous and fatuous sources. What can you possibly expect to learn from those? It's a mystery.
Good question. But what if we say " you are both of our child's". Is it ungrammatical?
Would this person fear all fictional characters, or only the evil ones? It seems like the latter from your example, but I wanted to make sure.
Did you change the verb inflexion from *knows* to *know* on purpose or was that just a typo?
Your question is a bit unclear to me.  For example if I changed the tense of the following sentence from past perfect to present: "I had gone the night before." to "I  go the night before." It's still grammatical but means something entirely different.  But, "I had finished eating when the package arrived." changing to present tense: "I finish eating when the package arrived." is not grammatical.  Is this what you're asking?

@Dragonrage it doesn't help, because it doesn't answer the question I asked; are you looking for a word to describe someone who does these things habitually? Or a word to refer to the perpetrator of a specific infraction. For example: "the speed limit in this school zone is 15. Violators *will* be ticketed" is a valid usage, but you wouldn't call those people 'violators' in the general sense outside of discussion of their infraction, the way you might a felon. That's the distinction I'm trying to draw out here.
A complex sentence has at least one dependent clause.  Do you know how to spot and classify clauses?
Possible duplicate of [What is the story behind "a-" prefix / suffix?](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/45886/what-is-the-story-behind-a-prefix-suffix)
From the answer to that question: "Such verb forms derive from an Old English construction in which a preposition, usually on, was placed in front of a verbal noun — a verb to which -ing had been added to indicate that the action was extended or ongoing. Gradually such prepositions were shortened to a- by the common linguistic process that shortens or drops unaccented syllables." What is not explained here about what it is?
If so, that answer later includes this: "This development is probably connected to the fact that a- was no longer interpreted as a preposition but **as a prefix**. As a consequence, the following ing-form was identified as verbal rather than nominal, in analogy to the much more common progressive." So this analysis for Modern English calls it a prefix, not an independent word. It seems odd to ask the grammatical category of a prefix; do you disagree with this analysis?

Why must someone be present to validate a quality inherent in something? The bug can be "disgusting" based on its potential to disgust a person entering its environs.

Please follow the guidelines for asking questions about words that fit a specific meaning: http://english.stackexchange.com/tags/single-word-requests/info One of the guidelines is to include an example sentence to show how you would like to use the word that you're asking for.

You seem to be giving "grammar" a dangerous degree of influence over your thoughts. Prescriptive grammar is a fallacy; a false god that only had as much power as we are willing to give it. Language evolves constantly, the healthy way to view grammar is as a descriptive tool for constructing and deciphering meanings. People who would tell you to not "verb nouns" are standing in the face of hundreds of years of precedent, and scornful of great writers going back before Shakespeare. Ask yourself "is 'rdp into' semantically meaningful?",  if so... Use it.

How do you intend to use them? In speech? Writing? With what context? I ask because, well, for example, they're all colloquial, and perhaps all localisms and regionalisms in addition. So, used in speech or writing, they may be mostly interchangable in meaning, but if you used the wrong one in the wrong place at the wrong time, you'd mark yourself as an outsider, a pretender, meet with noncomprehension, strike a dissonant note, or etc. So, how interchangable they are depends on the context of use.

What is your question exactly? Is it to determine the meaning of the sentence? Or to determine if the meaning of the sentence is mostly a quibble? Or are you wondering by "is it a quibble" whether asking for the meaning of that statement is a quibble?
Like @FumbleFingers, I feel like there is no more specific label for this phenomenon than 'mistake'. i.e. "You have used the wrong word, and here is why" followed by analysis. It sounds similar to 'malapropism' (the wrong word which sounds like the one you should have used) but rather using the wrong meaning word that only shares connotation. Would another example be possibly "Politicians are ugly" (because in some instances they show anger in public and that can be ugly)? Maybe the problem is 'fallacy of ambiguity' ?
In general, yes, although there are many exceptions, e.g. determiners. By the way, I have never heard of *substantiative*. Perhaps you mean *substantial* or *substantive* (less likely)?

death in terms of grammar is most likely the subject noun, but it depends on the context. Can you give an example sentence?
Your comment makes no sense to me.  Are you asking whether both versions (with and without the article) are grammatical?  Truth and falsity are semantic values.
The grammatically sound sentence "There is no largest prime" can never mean something untrue.  Does that help?
Never heard the variant with "mine" before. Where have you come across it? It might be possible to argue it's grammatical as in parseable, but it is clearly not idiomatic at all. As Edwin demonstrates in his comment, you can use it for comedic effect, but that's about it.
Better how, exactly?
Yes, grammar creates meaning.  If you switch the subject and object of a sentence, the structure and the semantics will change, but sentence classification doesn't have anything to do with the meaning of the sentence so classified.  It's a set of syntactic definitions.  You can tell because you can classify a sentence that has no meaning for you.  For instance, take the sentence *The gooberness is freejellish*.  Do you know what it means?  Can you still tell that it's simple anyway?

I think your 2-part split is interesting, as is your justification for it to be letterbox-specific vs broad locale.

Something else to consider: by what rule will you accept an answer if the question *is* reopened? Is it personal preference? Anecdotal support? Official classification or ...?
There is more than one definition of a sentence, and your examples fit most of them. If you think that these are not sentences, you are welcome to name them whatever you want. That won't change the fact that they are sitll sentences in other people's books. And even more to the point: why does it matter to you what you name these? What aspects of the world will change at all depending on whether you call these sentences *sentences*, *nominal groups*, or *Khabarovsks*? It's just a label. Label them *X42*. That's fine.
I fear you may be overthinking things a bit.  It's a common enough trope to personalize characteristics as entities separate from an individual, and once we do that we can make those entities subject or objects in their own grammatical right.  We speak of *buying* courage, *taking* courage, *borrowing* courage, etc.  Are we to consider *these* linking verbs?
@linguisticturn Maybe a question for stack linguistics? I don't know of one, but I'm rubbish at semantics stuff (very unfortunate given the thesis of my PhD!)

This seems to have come up before— on account of a grammar from That Other University— in *[Pronouns: a word class or a subclass of nouns?](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/42288)*, but there is no accepted answer. Also of possible interest (not a duplicate) is *[English parts of speech — better new treatments](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/69191)*.
It looks like your problem is understanding the French sentence, rather than expressing the idea in English. The word *monnaie* has several meanings, but in this sentence, it's unlikely to mean anything other than *currency*. *Money* is almost never an adequate translation. What's the context? It would settle the matter.
You mention English and South America. Are you talking about how they use this word in Guyana? Otherwise, are you talking about Spanish or Brazilian Portuguese? And which country for Spanish? And those are all entirely different languages from English so the connotations may be entirely different. Also, there's the primary denotative meaning, and then the pragmatic implications. 'Small' is a derogatory term for football players, but not for transistors.

You say, "[T]his field is required to be filled in *by someone else on a previous step.*" Sorry for being dense, but I do not quite understand. Can you put this in other words (or, if you prefer, if the quoted clause is inessential to the question, can you ask the question without the clause)?

Am I missing something? Most late = most recent. If event E happens after events F and G (all happening in the past, i.e. before 'now'), then the most late is E, and the most recent is also E.
To be more precise, both can be said, but the first one has a whole different meaning and is probably not the one you wanna use. If you say the first one, it's to actually give a reason why you shouldn't use a cotton base layer, whereas the second suggest you might wanna use a cotton base layer. "Why not to use a cotton base layer ? Because a cotton base layer would be bad.", "Why not use a cotton base layer? Because cotton is good."
Is this a more general question, "if X is its own word with plural Xa, but also X is sometimes short for Y, which has plural Ys - should we use Xs or Xa to mean Ys?"  or is it specific to each case? - hoping someone will know
A bit off-topic, but why would you do that? If I find that kind of thing and there's no useful explanation for it in version-control history or comments/documentation explaining why it's there, I delete it. It's bloating your repository, obscuring bug-hunting for maintenance-programmers who don't know you just parked that code, and if it's not reachable you cannot create tests for it, obscuring your test coverage reports. It's also a waste of resources to create something that is never used. Imagine a cook in a burger place making an extra box of sushi because _we might need it at some point_.
dormant code perhaps?
Even if we throw out all the preceding text, *[**We want**] to speed up our product launch into the market to generate revenue* sounds pretty clumsy to me. It's also *semantically* questionable in context. Who exactly will be *receiving* the generated revenue? More crucially, who will be *paying?* Your text looks like a flyer to actual/potential *customers*, who might not particularly want to be told how pleased you are that you've thought of new and better ways of getting their money.

Your two examples are fine to label as irony. Can you post the text of (or at least link to) some examples that you think aren't?
Are you trying to say that even though he was influenced by others at first, he still had his own style even then, or that he developed his own style after he was influenced? I assumed the latter, but you could use "even then" instead of "then" to make it clearer if it's the former.
Most non-finite clauses are subjectless, though the subject is usually retrievable form the matrix clause. The non-finite clause in your example is no exception: it is subjectless, but it's clear that it is "he" (or more precisely the referent of "he") who loves something, and since it is the travelling that is loved, the subject of the subordinate non-finite clause can only be "he". Why do you think that "to travel" is a prep phrase?
Why do you think the sentence might not work? Do you have any other examples you're not sure about?
How about 'failsafe'? "3. Guaranteed not to fail" (*American Heritage*). I suppose 'foolproof' is another option.
*No matter what you hear in there, no matter how cruelly I beg you, no matter how terribly I may scream, do not open this door or you will undo everything I have worked for. Do you understand? Do not open this door.*
What are you intending when you say *irreligious*? Its usual meaning is *indifferent or hostile to religion*, with a strong flavour of being 'anti-religion'. .And a lot of people who are indifferent or hostile to religion say *thank God*. My sense is that you are looking for an expression which does not touch upon religion in any way. In other words you are looking for a *non-religious* term. Am I right?
Are you trying to say, "One should always have a professional attitude, regardless of the way they look" - ?
What is your context?
***He** drove his car at a youth*. That action ***resulted in** the youth being flung onto the car roof*. Just the same as *The CEO resigned, resulting in a boardroom power struggle*, where the subject could be referred to as *The CEO who resigned, resulting in a boardroom power struggle, issued a statement last night explaining his actions*. What don't you understand?
Perhaps you could find a cite to these general rules, because even assuming that you mean *implies* when you write "infers", I don't believe the claim.  Both sentences mean that the weather is bad in England.  If you remove *In England,* the sentence will be understood to mean that the weather is bad in the speaker's location.  Are you thinking of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses?  There's a difference between *This is the bad weather that England is famous for* and *This is bad weather, which England is famous for*.  But that's different.
Good question. But if there isn't, would you settle for something that is not up to your specifications?

You say that Latin 'q' is related to Germanic 't' but I suspect you mean that 'q' is related to Germanic 'hw'/'wh' (since [xʷ] seems much more likely to be spelled as 'hw' than as 't'!).  Is that correct?
If *pastoral care* is the full range of activities a pastor brings to his congregation, isn't the recipient simply a *congregant*?

My non-online Oxford Compact Dictionary gives a third meaning for immaculate of 'without fault'. Only the person who drafted the ad knows exactly what the intent was, but I think it is as likely, if it is a 'fine dining' establishment that they would be trying to rule out candidates who were not willing or able to speak without excessive idiom. In other words, it is as likely to be about class as about immigration status, innit?
The Portuguese example is wrong (unless you're asking someone what they call it personally, unlike the other examples). It should be Como se chama isso? or Como se chama a isso?, with **se** in both cases, though they have different grammatical functions; in the first case _se_ is non-argumental and called _inerente_ , while in the second it is argumental and called _impessoal/nominativo_. The second case is interesting because _chamar_ is the only verb in Portuguese that has such a construction where there's a predicative over an indirect object (_chamei-**lhe** parvo_).
Are you sure it doesn't say _making use **of** the assumption_? In that case is basically means the same as _using the assumption_. Otherwise, it seems to be a typo...
Supposedly, the equivalent is "The (parish) priest forgets that he was a clerk"... but I've never heard this English idiom! http://internationalcongress.aiesec.org/2016/04/19/polish-sayings/ (Now that I've read that article, I wonder: where does "beka" come from?)

Both the examples look more like "slavish copycat" than what I'd normally think of as "easily influenced", since in both cases it's unlikely the speaker actually *intended* to influence the [toady?, sycophant?].

I don't think 'generic' is an appropriate term: have you looked it up in a dictionary?  What's wrong with "common words" or "commonly used words"?  In either case, you perhaps need to specify what you are referring to as 'common words': you mention only a few, but are words such as "that", "which", "do", etc. included in that scope.

Actual native speakers would almost never use ***invitee*** or ***inviter*** anyway - for example, we'd always ask *Who invited you? Were you invited?*, not *Who was your inviter? Are you an invitee?* On ELL my advice would simply be "Forget about *both* words".
Were you thinking of *shibboleth*? It starts with 's' and has 3 syllables, as required, but normally functions in a somewhat different sense of 'identifying someone'.
It's easy to find examples from literature of "fluke" meaning a lucky accident.  Are you interested in these, or are you only interested in literary examples of "fluke" that mean an unlucky accident or a accident that is neither lucky nor unlucky?

Is that an example of covert ageism/sexism in your eyes?
What's the broader context? Is it about education admin?
From a programming perspective, you now have a generalization from 1 source language to 2 possible source languages. As a next step you would probably want to generalize even further to *n* languages (in other words, what happens when you want to expand to add `DE`, `JP`, etc. into the mix?). In which case the class/method name would simply be `Translate`. Your source and/or target language would then be either arguments or type arguments (if using something like generics) - depending on your design and implementation, and taking the possibility of auto-detection of the source into account.

Honestly, "How do you call it?" doesn't sound all that bad to me; it's like a blend of "How do you say ___?" and "What do you call it?" (Though I grew up in a family of immigrants, so it's possible that certain non-nativisms sound less bad to me than to others.)
Defintely add the article. "Press X button" sounds off. Forget about software, look at sentences like "press the red button", "cut the green wire", öpen the left door", etc. Google may help to convince you. The definite article is used when you specify a specific instance of a concept, so why not use it?
(Just a guess, but might it be that Hindi doesn't have an equivalent to the way most Anglophones would use ***it*** in such contexts today?)
You have actually asked two questions here? One in your question title and and another about the new activity. Please clarify.
Adverbs can of course 'belong' in noun phrases. In your second example the second coordinate is the NP _and the man_. Inserting "never" gives an 'expanded' second coordinate in which _and/but never the man_ is an **NP**. This is clearly a constituent so what other category could it belong to? “Never” is marking the second coordinate, indicating the relation of the bare coordinate "the man" to the coordination. So your example is analysed as a coordination of two NPs. I think this is much better than saying it's a coordination of VPs (or clauses), with ellipsis within the second coordinate.
Whoever downvoted me.  Might be good to tell me why my solution was not useful.  This is why I hate posting on stackexchange.  Why do I even help?  Deleted a good solution and won't be posting in this English area again.

1 can be correct if 'Herring' is a person's name.  However, outside of that context, I would agree with you.  That said, what is your actual question?  Are you asking if you're correct?
Why do you assume that one is incorrect? The answers there are the answers you need. When you use singular, it means one thing. Plural means two things. That's how English works. You only thought it was wrong because you failed to undestand that it was one thing not two.
So mean like how if you want to get rid of a **cough**, you decant some anti-**tussive** concoction? That's simply using Latin-derived terms for technical stuff.
Heh, well, in my previous comment, the whole point of using `x` and `y` was to show how little the names matter if the language in question can imply the comparison order.  Anyway, I think the question you ended up asking is not quite the question you meant to ask.  (Is there a term for this? :-) )
I don't have any cites for this (beyond the popular song https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whispering_Grass ) , but I could easily conceive of a poetic or folkloric idea that the blades of grass are tongues which speak, if only we listen.

If we ever make it to even the nearest (Andromeda, 2.5 million light years away), we'd almost certainly be capable of going beyond the Local Group (which is "only" 10 Mly across).
I'm not sure I understood your question but *atomic* is described as "of or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system", and it's corresponding noun would be *atomicity*. Does that come close to what you were looking for?

@chiastic-security Knowing what you know now, from the Answers below, what would you use in place of sick?
Was there any particular motivation that got you to ask this question? Like, were you casually reading Chaucer, as one does, and saw the word 'blue' and wondered how he would have said 'light blue'? You do realize that a legitimate answer was 'They didn't bother'. For example, what is the term that Middle English have for 'indigo'? It was probably just 'purple' since Newton came up with the term indigo himself (for some intermediate shade of purple). Also, for clarification, are you looking for a systematic construction or is one 'light' word for each color OK?
I'm surprised that you'd think 'no answer' is not a legitimate answer. Some languages have only 3 color terms. You're asking a question like 'how did a language which only has a word for the range red-to-yellow say red?' The point is they just don't. So I'm not sure what is an acceptable answer. Also, what is 'light'? Less saturated in an HSV model. 'Bright' sounds like _more_ saturated to me.
Do you mean "em dash" rules?
Are you referring to the Y axis markers being in multiples of 10, or to the way your data has a spike extending every 10 degrees?  (Although, either way, I'd probably phrase it as "10-degree intervals" or "at intervals of 10 degrees".)
Are the only angles from the set {0, 10, ... 350}? I'm seeing one point at (0,-40) (corresponds to 270 deg) and another at about (3, 28) (corresponds to 80 deg). Nice graph, by the way.

I'm not sure what you mean by 'misreading'. Did I misread the title word 'doggerel', it's dictionary definition, or your statement 'bad or ineffectual? Which of those three, or other, is your primary intent?
It partly depends on what you meant by your question to E. Did you mean "Have you spoken to C *since lunch yesterday*?" Or "*Did* you speak to C at lunch yesterday?" It further depends on what E meant. Was she being evasive, hence admitting only "We met [and mind your own business whether we talked]"? Was she being sarcastic - "Yes, didn't you see us at lunch together? Of course we spoke!"
Certainly not. While I can't think of any context where these words would come together, if they did I would pronounce it /'mʌstəv/. I don't even have the sound /ɒ/ in my phoneme inventory (I'm American). Have you learned about vowel reduction and weak forms yet? It's important to reduce unstressed vowels to schwa in function words like "of" if you're aiming for a native-sounding accent.
So what is wrong with "die of a broken heart"? It's just too long for you?
@Newcomer Is it possible that all you are looking for is the word 'spectrum'?
Relevant post on Latin SE: [Does the “re” in emails have an ancient origin?](http://latin.stackexchange.com/questions/931)
Are you perhaps thinking of [synecdoche](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/synecdoche) *(a figure of speech in which a part is used for the whole or the whole for a part)?* In your specific context, there can be a "kernel" and a "shell", within which one might say only the kernel is the "OS". I think that's essentially what the [GNU/Linux naming controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy) is all about.
Can you be more specific about the kind of term you want? You've already mentioned "silent letters"; this really seems the best and most straightforward option to me.  I don't think it has anything to do with grammar, and the entire concept is not very well defined phonetically (there are unsolvable issues like "is the s or c silent in *scent*"; and "if the l in *calm* is silent, why isn't it pronounced the same way as *cam*?").
Dis you consider *history*?
Do you want a word with a positive or a negative connotation?
why is such a word necessary in the first place? What is wrong with camel rider to start with?
Would asoporific work?
Why would you want to have non-functional code? That makes no sense to me.
Dan, speaking of "origins": you know you owe us the missing piece of the puzzle, right? "OK, I've done that. – Dr Chuck Jun Awesome. Comment withdrawn, downvote reversed, upvoted. – Dan Bron" So... What did Dr Chuck Jun do? :-o Please. You baitlined us here. (For one,  I came via a legit "entomology" search! ;-p )
The appropriate alternative depends on the specific sense of your example, that is, how does your program modulate others? Does it separate the others' code into modules? Does it temper the others' effects in some way? Does it intervene between others and some third program or programs?
Please clarify what types of 'applications', 'collections', etc. you are referring to: computer programs (which is what I first thought of when reading "applications"); art; clothing; ... .  In a comment below, you mention 'news stories' - what type of news?  Where is your sentence to be used: in a journal; on the internet; ...?
To clarify: I wasn't trying to be sarcastic with the quotation marks around "not a word" in my previous post. I just didn't want to use that phrase without some kind of indicator that it is a very problematic concept. I can understand being leery of online dictionaries, but what criteria would you use to determine whether or not you would be comfortable using a word?
Why not? How can the entire East Coast be *one* entity, but a contiguous section of the West Coast be multiple entities? (Please see my answer below.)
Here's a related question, but I don't think the answer explains very much: [Why are some “-ist” suffixed words used as the adjective form over the more common “-istic”?](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/220753)
What about “***the book cellar***”?
Is the term you're looking for gender-specific? That is, could a group of men also use the single word?
This question comes with assumptions:  1) There exists *a woman* that *any* man would want to "share [their?] life with"...  2) That if one or more such women exist, they would be "successful, fit, attractive, and intelligent."  3) That these "amazing" women do exist, and have grouped together the better to find their mates.  Yet '1)' is held to be a *good thing*, that these women must be desired by all, but are themselves extremely particular, which seems both inconvenient for their mostly useless admirers, who by virtue of their numbers become obstructive to these women's search...
Are you looking for something active like moderating or just something neutral like indifference?
Hint:  Was the review perhaps referencing a holiday-themed movie, that would be shown almost exclusively on or near that holiday, *every year*?
Why is **hide** not okay? Facebook uses "hide" to restrict visibility of photos you're tagged in.
I know Google Books doesn't record italicisation, but it ignores non-letters (except insofar as an indexedable "word" is any sequence of letters bounded by non-letters). So if you check out the hits for [Interpol International](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=%22Interpol+Inter%22#q=%22Interpol+International%22&tbm=bks&start=20) you'll find that in many if not *most* of them, the context is the acronym immediately followed by the "definition". Clearly UPPER CASE is [almost?] never used. Personally I think italics/bold is just patronising misuse of modern DTP typesetting features.
Are you asking about (e.g.) /*parents*/ vs /*parentses*/ in the pronunciation?
Something completely different? Like why the _s_ that's not there is not pronounced? The fact that is is not written is a good indication that it shouldn't be pronounced either. Spelling normally follows speech, after all. Just like the omitted _O_ in my earlies examples (from _not_) is not pronounced when it's omitted.
Can you spell it how you *think* it's spelled? I get that you don't seem to think it's correct but we may be able to recognize the word by sounding it out phonetically from what you think it is.
Perhaps *rentier*?
@rapt the answer is pretty much a direct phonetic mapping from what the speaker says so it's strange you didn't hit on "rentier definition" fairly quickly. Are you sure that this isn't a way to direct us to revolutionary politic speeches on YouTube ?
Perhaps you could use *saving* instead?
Please provide an example of the context that you want to use the word for. Are you looking for a general word, something regarding technology solutions? Does your everyone need to be absolute?
Scientifically sterile? Is this figuratively sterile, statistically sterile, virtually sterile, metaphorically sterile, or actually sterile? Before rephrasing the sentence, I have to understand it. What does scientifically mean?
@Desthstro It looks like TRomano was focusing on the syntax. I was looking at the semantics. If we assume "at" was a typo, do our comments together answer your question? (You can also ping to ask TRomano directly by using the "@" convention as I did with your username.)
You already have an answer. What exactly are you asking others?
Do you differentiate between having the capacity to work on all of them if you were to learn them and having experience with all of them?  Have you worked on AIX, VxWorks, ThreadX, FreeRTOS, LynxOS, minix, EmBOS, Vax VMS...?
Welcome to ELU. Can you provide a little more context around the phrase? The whole sentence or the surrounding sentences would be quite helpful.
This does not answer the question exactly, but if I am parsing the question correctly, you want to indicate that she is habitually irrational while excusing her for some of the fault during this one instance. Is that right? If that is the case, I think it would be better written as: "Sharon may have acted irrationally, but it was not entirely her fault this time." This time implies there are other times she acts irrationally, since it suggests you feel the need to specify an exemption for a particular instance of irrationality, which would be unnecessary if there event was a singularity.
What research have you done? What do you understand "Inspissate" to mean?
Can you provide the context where you have seen this word used?  I have never heard of it or run across it in all my biblical or literary perusals.
Can you elaborate on _why_ you would want to replace a couple of very well-understood words, and do so in what I understand to be a formal context? Especially in a formal context, I would expect your audience to know and understand the two words well, probably better and more readily than a set of custom words to describe the same concepts.
The Unbearable Lightness of Being?
Could you add an example of a situation where you might use the expression? I have a few ideas, but I'm not sure I fully understand the original idiom.
You probably just want one obvious thing that says 'that dude must be black'? Language is pretty complex: there's the barely perceptible lilt in ones speech and then there's obvious things like distinct vocab and grammar. And then there's the fact that ethnicity is as determinable from language as from religion. Quick answer: as in the article, one example, dropping 'is' - 'she is fine' -> 'she fine'.
Do you want to retain the negative connotation of "Doubting Thomas"?
Can you [edit] this to show a picture of what you're asking about? :)
In your field, is the term *heavy metals* used as a [plurale tantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurale_tantum) in that context - in particular, without an article (a/an/the)? If so, your second example sounds like something to do with a type of sound that some call music and others call noise.
When I first read the title, the word that came to mind was "real" (granting that God created reality). Is the intent to imply that HIV (or whatever) is somehow separate from God's creation? Or is it more to imply non-existence of God?
Did you mean: *gripping* (firmly holding the attention or interest; exciting) or *griping* (express a complaint or grumble about something, especially something trivial)?
If you got that quotation from the [dictionary here](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/conceit), then the definitions 2-6 should be all you need to understand it. If not, what is it that you don't get?
No, the interpretation you've suggested strikes me as obviously wrong.  "Every five years" is a frequency.  Imagine you substituted "at least annually."  Would you still argue for that interpretation?
@gral.pancho.villa The problem is that you've provided a term *and* its definition in a foreign language (*foreign* relative to English, that is), neither of which is comprehensible to those who don't understand the other language. So you can see where I'm coming from, consider a term *blah* whose definition is *blaa blab blac* in some foreign language. How do you determine what *blah* means when you understand neither *blah* nor *blaa blab blac*? A translation of (most of) the words in your Spanish definition would help.
What branch of math involves statements such as these? Are you referring to logic as math?
You could do something like _consummated one's believe never is..._ but that sounds strange (though grammatical). Why would you want that? It makes you sound like Star Wars' [Yoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda).
I wasn't familiar with this usage of that word, so unfortunately I can't answer your question. I have edited the titleslightly to censor the obscene word; this is [an established policy of the SE network](http://meta.english.stackexchange.com/questions/2357/censorship-of-offensive-questions). I'm curious why you refer to "cunt" as a British loan word--how is it any more a loan than the rest of Australian English?
E2 must occur __after__ E1. Did you check a thesaurus for alternatives?
Well... do you want the person reading to pause between "obey" and "or"? Comma usage is often a matter of style, not a matter of prescription... I think this is one of those cases.
Context.......?
You probably meant *pause* rather than *pose*? Although the person is possibly posing while pausing...
So what exactly would that word or sentence mean? Can you give a short definition of the word you are looking for? I was thinking of "**bravery/dauntlessness/daring**" for instance.
You have a source that says you're right, so what do you want from us? The best answers on here use sources, but there's not much point me copying your source and using it as a basis for my answer.
Why do you think that this usage of "ago" is incorrect?
@Pureferret You mean, like "Pureferret the Second", or "Pureferret Jr", or "Pureferret III"? I'd consider that a different sort of repetition, not a *recursive reference*.
Do you mean "fuzzy", as in "fuzzy logic"?
Can you explain why you think it's ungrammatical? Seems perfectly standard to me.
Go ahead and say it: your teacher is wrong. The first sentence says that slavery had no institution comparable -- that's the *such* -- to it with regard to exploitation of physical ability. The second sentence (fragment), says that situation changed with the advent of college football, which is now comparable to slavery in that area. It's irrelevant whether the sentiment is true or which institution is worse. Can you get a better teacher?
Are you thinking of [tag:kinship-terms]? Ordinarily, however, this label is only used for familial relationships.
Are you thinking of *substantial*?
So Martin Luther King's use of metaphor doesn't work for you in this case, then? Note that the collocation [moral arch](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph  moral+arch&year_start=1900&year_end=2000&corp  15&smoothing=10&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cmoral%20arch%3B%2Cc0) was probably far from unknown to him. He just creatively added another layer of metaphor to what was already there.
Can you elaborate the context? One must escape from the prison because the monster is _in_ the prison? Or is it on the loose in the outside world?
Spartacizing?  :-)
Better in what sense?
Presumably, what you describe as a *one knob tap*, as well as its knob controlling the temperature, requires another knob to control the flow?
One could certainly say that they were ***on*** their computer when they are ***at*** their computer when connected to a network ***online***. And even then, most (wifi?) networks don't use "lines".
I think your assessment of the gamer's usage is at the very least *pedantic*, if not out-and-out *misguided*. I find even just the tiny fragment you've given here easy enough to understand, because the metaphoric *need for meat **and** potatoes* isn't at all uncommon. But reducing it to just ***meat*** seems a bit too obscure (as would be the case with *The game should have lots of **beef***, which I wouldn't instantly recognize as an allusion to the idiomatic [Where's the beef?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_the_beef%3F), implying a lack of "substance").
If you gave us the pin yin for your daughter's name we might find a English name that would sound like it. Isn't that how Chinese people give Europeans Chinese names?
In this phrase, is there any sense of resentment on the part of the turtle? Is the child somewhat angry at the parent, or are they just naively declaring their independence? Some of the answers offered here may be less fitting, depending on the emotions involved in the original.

Did the flow rate increase on one hundred occasions, or did it increase and is now on a level 100 times of that it was before?
Is the translator translating literally while the speaker is speaker, or after she says something? Probably not at the same time, hence (I think) "she tells me."  BTW, "She is telling me" would most likely be "She's telling me" when spoken.
What is *RHS*? Is this an onomatopoeic exclamation? The initials of an organization?
It sounds as if it might be a response which builds upon something earlier in the dialogue, perhaps like a comparison to something just mentioned. Would you please give us more context, if you are able?
Hypercorrection? Such as "Please have dinner with my husband and I" or "Please contact John and myself"?
Are you someone who programs analysts?  Someone who analyzes programs?  Someone who programs and analyzes something else?
It's a subarea of analysis so they would be 'analysts'. That word has lots of other uses so probably not the best. Also, don't you think mathematicians would know better? You may want to ask there.
This might be a bit broad for one expression to capture all of it at once. Do you have some examples where you would want to use your phrase contemporary?
@Kirill What kind of tone is it? Consoling, belittling, upbeat or just explanatory?
How about *objectionable*? Or, *distasteful, unsavory*?
Isn't the answer 'renter'?
You can't really answer this question by learning more about English. You're basically asking "what's the best way to deal with this social situation?" Factors like your company's culture and your relationship with your team leader will affect this just as much as, or more than, linguistic factors. Maybe there was no type of refusal that would have made your team leader happy. Who can say?
Do you know about our sister site for learners, [ell.se]?

Was the student questioned about being bullied?
@Yasha Yes, that helps. Are you talking about the girl doing things on a *whim*? That is, she just 'felt like doing it' and so she built the house because she could, once she got the inheritance? Or are you saying that it was 'expected' of her to build a house once the inheritance money came in, so she gave in to the people telling her to build, instead of making up her own mind about what she wanted to do with the money?
In France, the pronunciation is \nu.ɡa\, there is no "r" or "t" sound at the end... I wouldn't be surprised to hear a stranger pronuncing the "t" (as you say, "nugget")... but the "r" surprises me... Maybe it helps pronuncing the "a" sound the right way ?
*Tormentor*...?
*saccharine* has a figurative meaning of 'sickly sweetness' which also carries connotations on insincerity. BTW, what is it that he is well versed *in*?
This seems like a contradiction: the character is cynical and cruel, speaks sweetly (which will make him sound scornful/condescending), and you don't want this to convey bitterness or scorn? I think that can only be conveyed through characterisation.
An *unkeepable secret*? *Irresistible gossip*?
I suggest carrying *What Do You Care What Other People Think?* by Richard Feynman
What so-called rule of grammar has your research suggested that this sentence would somehow be in violation of?
I've never heard of such a concept. Where did you get the idea from? I'm not sure it's exactly On Topic to ask about the suitability of some arbitrarily selected usage in the absence of any suggestion that it *might* not be considered appropriate.
Is this written or spoken? Is this between native speakers, or with non-native speakers, or a mix?
Is your primary goal with this recording to entertain (so people can enjoy watching your creative process), or to teach people how to do it themselves, or to give them an introduction to what the equipment and software can be used to make, or as publicity for you to increase your sales of something, or...?  More information would be very helpful.
To clarify - are you looking for a word to modify *increased*? Since *increased* is a verb, aren't you looking for an *adverb*, not an *adjective*? Or are you looking for a word to modify *security*?
In that case, why are you looking for an adjective (*cf* your question's title)? Note that [*consequently*](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/consequently) (see scenario 1) is an adverb.

I think to most people the words you use are simply jargon and so just confuse matters, could you give another example with more common-place words?
Nevertheless, if we are to accurately help you we need to be able to fully understand the question, whilst keeping your current example up, could you add another example with common-place words just so that we get how it is being used? For instance *the total calories for this portion can be explained in terms of chips, sausages and  bacon, **as well as** [the] external calories, given in Eq. 1*.  This may be total gibberish, but it clearly gets across which words are of which classification of word etc. so that no confusion can be caused.
What about [quadtree region/cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) ?
The equator is defined as latitude 0, so the question *At what degree latitude is Earth's equator located?* is similar to *At what degree latitude is latitude 15ª located?*. IMHO, you use coordinates to specify the location of other things. The coordinates themselves are not "located" anywhere.
I can't think of a single-word answer, but in this instance, does '*darker retelling* of xxx comic' work? Otherwise it might be 'inspired by xxx', 'derivative of xxx', or as you have already suggested it could be 'a story which references xxx'.

Because "a" and "o" both have numerous possible pronunciations, could you please clarify using [International Phonetic Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart_for_English_dialects) exactly which sounds you mean here, and in both cases? If you spell it *Spalding*, people will be most apt to pronounce it [ˈspɔːldɪŋ].
Can you give more examples than 'finish'? Are you saying that English borrowed no other verbs from French than those ending in '-ish'?
The OED has _-ish_ _suffix_ "A suffix forming adjs., of Common Germanic origin; Gothic _-isks_, ON. _-iskr_, Old High German, Old Saxon, Old Frisian, Old English _-isc_, German, Dutch _-isch_: cognate with Greek -_ισκ-ος_ dim. suffix of ns., so I'm not entirely sure why you think this suffix is borrowed from French?  I'm sure there are others that do; _-esque_, for example.

I cannot find the duplicate that I’m pretty sure exists, but this has been going on for 400 years, so it is as clearly grammatical in the minds of native speakers as it is disparaged by prescriptivists telling people what to do.  CGEL says: “Overrides with 3rd person reflexives characteristically occur in contexts where the antecedent refers to the person whose perspective is being taken in the discourse.”  For now, [see this for more](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=22979).
Is the question about "people like you" vs "people such as you" or is it about irregardless vs regardless?
That was also the whole point of the advertising campaign. The line after that was "What do you want, good grammar or good taste?". The idea being that only pedants worry about details like this, most people use the less formal wording, and they were appealing to all these ordinary folk to enjoy their cigarettes. It also made use the pun in "good taste", which could refer to either flavor or adherence to acceptable norms.
Are you asking about the definition of *group* or about the use of *collective nouns* (such as *flock*, *school*, *pride*, etc...)?

Quod sine die (without day), perhaps? The letter s with a macron is short for *sine*. Since I have no Latin, it's the best that I can do.
With a line over the s ... Did you mean s̄ ? It makes me believe that you have a handwritten letter. But more context is needed or a miracle.
If I had someone doing my shopping for me and I was on the phone with them asking about their progress, I might just ask, "Where are you on the list?" or "What are you looking for now?" or just, "Almost done?" and let them respond.

Are you looking specifically for a term applicable only to electronic gadgetry, or a more general term that could describe say, the clothing to which jewelry and handbags are accessories, or the sailboat to which a spinnaker and hiking harness are accessories?  Further, the single-word-request tag requires that you provide a sample sentence where the word would be used.
Could you format that wall of text a little bit please? To me, "I'm eating every day" sounds like you're putting "every day" in your mouth and swallowing it.

You have accepted an answer that advises users to use the term overseas Polish. Of course, in English Polish is not used as a mass noun for Polish people, and so anyone coming here for expert advice may find themselves unwittingly producing gibberish in their important document or assignment. Would you mind considering unselecting that answer, please?  Tommy's answer looks impeccable to me ...

I've tried to edit your question into what I believe you are actually asking here: why it’s ok to use a past perfect construction here rather than a plain past. Please look through [these questions](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sp-vs-past-perfect?sort=votes&pageSize=50) for a possible duplicate that may answer you. I saw quite a few likely candidates, but I can’t tell which aspect of this matter is the one which concerns you.  “Why is this right/ok/grammatically correct/sounds good?” questions with no further explanation or background and research are a bit broad for us.
What's the issue?
What makes you think your assessment would not be accurate. It's there exactly as you describe it. Have you noticed people using it differently?
Shouldn't there be a comma after `i.e.` ? I thought that was the preferred usage, though I always have an odd pause when writing or typing it. For the main issue, `(i.e., me)` sounds better to me  than `(i.e., I)`
I would suggest "obliviousness" instead. People *might* figure out what you mean by "oblivience" but, then again, they might not. Why risk confusion?
So there's no religious context? In that case, using the term *holy* would just cause confusion. If this 'data' is not to be questioned (by laymen), then it could be called *sacrosanct*. Anyone with an entrenched viewpoint should get the meaning readily enough.
Did you consider _self-preserving_?
Can you give an example of how you would use this word? Just like a class of students is different from a platoon of soldiers or a demographic of voters, a network of AIs might be different from a line of AIs.
As you (and Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau ) observe, a portmanteau word fuses both the sounds *and* the meanings of its components. Do your merged words have a meaning of their own? What *is* a Morgan Freemango, what does one *do* with a disconnecktie?
I cannot understand the question. Square bracke   [...] And regular brackets aka parentheses (...). So what exactly are you talking about here??

Welcome to EL&U. For the two forms in question (about the bakery), which do you think is clearer? What does your research show? Could you post any research?
Is that "number of courses" or "a number of cases"?
Is this a thing? Something that is very soft because it's far away? Your ears are literally on the side of your head... which means they are already on your periphery... Where is this sound originating? Can you explain more exactly what you're looking for?
I think that the answer for this is going to change based on the number of bets. "Double or nothing" can be used for situations when you can increase your winnings, and often do it multiple times in a chain or walk away. Contrasting: if you want a single instance bet that could decide fates you get "All or nothing" which are bets you don't want to do multiple times because of how much risk is involved. Did you have an idea of how often you are talking about?
What do you mean for "Luke"? It is pronounced as /luːk/, with the same vowel as duke and nuke (all 3 words rhyme). Are you referring to the absence of the palatal glide /j/, which most British English speakers have in /djuːk/ and /njuːk/?
What kind of fruit did you have in mind? Would something like pear-shaped work?
This question doesn't really make sense. Poets chose to write in Iambic pentameter because they wanted to. Why did they want to? Well, you need to ask a historian but I imagine the traditions derived from Latin and Greek were factors. Languages with word stress patterns do, of course, have their own rhythm, but it's inevitably irregular and in the mind of classically influenced poet an irregular and naturally occurring meter is probably insufficient. That's why they tend to work English's natural stress pattern into a precise meter, such as iambic.
No offence, but this question seems to be more about your dismissive attitude towards Iambic pentameter than an actual question. Many English speaking poets evidently did feel there was something special about, which is why they worked so hard to fit the natural rhythm of English into it's meter. Many modern poets don't use it, well obviously, many modern poets don't even care about meter. "what, if anything, is the natural rhythm of spoken English?" This question doesn't really make sense, English doesn't have a strict meter, there are just natural linguistic patterns in stress.

This is a very broad topic. There is a whole tag for [doubled-consonants](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/double-consonant?sort=votes&pageSize=50) with 47 questions. Note that "apple" and "maple" have different vowel sounds.
Why questions can be a bit vague. Are you interested most in how double consonants work in the current English spelling system, or in the history of how double consonants came to be used in English spelling?
Not a duplicate but similar to http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/350836/a-thing-whose-name-is-hard-to-track-down That question was more focused on the **name** which is is hard to pinpoint, whereas here you seem to be to seeking its **description/definition**?
Consider turning the issue around: what's the Chinese equivalent of the verb _prefer_? Does that imply a value judgement as well? If not, try to have them explain the difference to you. If yes, then I guess it may be some subtle difference of implicit cultural perspectives,
How about _smithy_?
Is there a reason you want it to be one word rather than, say, a two word phrase? For example 'help me express the optional nature of the assignment more clearly/express the discretionary nature more clearly'?
Are you looking for necessary is to optional (ADJ) as necessity is to X? "Dinner is necessary but dessert is optional" -> "Dinner is a necessity but dessert is X"?
Still sounds like paraphrasing, to me. How do you distinguish what you are trying to describe from paraphrasing? Paraphrasing is saying the same thing, or similar, but not in the same words.

Need further clarification as to what the intended meaning is. The idiomatic expression and the figurative translation provided don't go together in English. Which are we looking for?

Just based on a 59-second Google search, it appears that "what" can be used in a few contexts that aren't questions (or related to implies questions), e.g., "what a shame" and "what will be, will be". "What if" is implicitly short for "What would happen if ..." (or similar), but it may have transcended that mold, and become a phrase unto itself — "What If?" is the 12th result in my search for "what". (OK, that's cheating — it's https://what-if.xkcd.com.) Maybe the other wh– words aren't as flexible.
If I understood right, this is part of a written interview.  If so, could you give us the question this excerpt is responding to?

Also, if you have seen a pattern in that regard, please share. // What is the Polish-British author's creative medium?

As @Janus points out, your *specific* example is obviously auto-generated by a simple algorithm that doesn't reflect actual usage accurately. I hadn't realised when I linked to it that there was an answer of my own there (which I don't disown, despite the net -6 downvotes) - but if you don't like that answer, perhaps you'll like something on [this](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28433/f) or [this](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1366/). Or ask a less obviously *Is this a software error?* type of question on English Language Learners (where it belongs).
I don't think I've missed anything. I don't think this is really a valid question in the first place (here *or* on ELL), because effectively you're just asking us to "proofread" the output from a simple website that's clearly not even *intended* to exemplify "correct" syntax. But all those earlier questions were asked before ELL even existed. If you really still have a problem, why don't you just ask *on the right site?* And *don't* base your question on just one clearly incorrect autogenerated  example.
ELU is a site for [linguists, etymologists, and (serious) English language enthusiasts.](http://english.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) Feasibly we might be interested exploring the whys and wherefores of some particular idiomatic usage, but in this case it seems your emphasis is more a matter of asking *what native speakers actually say*. The fact that one bit of low-grade formatting code causes you to doubt your own understanding of "syntactically acceptable" usage in this context implies you *are* a "learner", so why don't you want to use the site specifically set up to address your needs?

Are you postulating a scenario where you'd rather A than B, *and* you'd rather C than D, and you want to convey that one of those preferences is stronger than the other? You can certainly say *I'd rather A than B, but I'd **much** rather C than D*, which would contextually imply that the latter preference is stronger. But I don't think English has any easy way of *explicitly* conveying that "second order preference" using the word ***rather*** (that's to say, ***more rather*** doesn't really work for me).

Why would you need something current? *Avoiding like the plague* gets the message across perfectly. Though we have not happily had a plague epidemic in Britain in recent centuries, everyone knows what the plague was, and no one would want to risk getting it.

He felt very ill for some while, but being bacterial rather than viral it is easily knocked on the head with modern antibiotics.)

@aparente001 - I'm clearly missing something here. You want a word but you don't know what that word should mean?

A thesaurus for [simplistic](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/simplistic%20?s=t) gives childish (which I think is slightly more judgmental), and clicking on [childish](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/childish) gives "naïve".

It is interesting that in all your examples the word _space_ is used metaphorically. Your _life–death_ use case carries a strong suggestion of a transition, which seems to have influenced some of the answers; it is less clear whether you intend it in that way in _fear–love_ or _knowing–believing_. If it _is_ transitional, is a return possible? Perhaps you could tell us more about what sort of _space_ you are thinking of: is it the time between_A_ and _B_, the intermediate space on a spectrum of possibilities (which works with _fear–love_) or something else again? Or should it be quite general?
Isn't emotional person what you're looking for? How about  unreserved one?
Linguists study language... make a career out of it.  It seems to me that might be enough.  Would you need to say "passionate chef"  or is "chef" enough to imply that a person is passionate about cooking?  I'd say "chef" is enough.  You might need to say "amateur linguist" if they're not actually trained,  but even while tempering the title you still suggest a real passion for the field.
In my experience *random* is not used colloquially in the way you suggest. I think you are just misusing it. Any evidence that it is often used that way, i.e., to mean *of unknown origin*?
What situation?
Horizontal follows a specific plane. The line that extends from the viewer to the horizon would all depend on where the viewer is standing.

@Eddie The bathroom example is pretty extreme, so I guess you're getting at something that "really isn't even in consideration despite technically being an option" ? "an unacceptable alternative"?

I don't get the example. You say that you don't like people if they're not similar enough to you. Your friend says she understands you.

Unfortunately if “most of the heat comes from the garlic” it is not really that hot.

This is a lost cause. There is no way to legislate the way other people talk, and even if you find for yourself a foolproof formula for *saying* the numbers in an easily recognizable way, others won't, and you'll still be saying "Fifty?" and having them say, "No, fif*teen*!"
Have you looked at the duplicate? What matters is what you actually say. Speech is primary and the spelling follows directly from that, without tricks, surprises, or exceptions.

Are you thinking of [discrete](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/customizing_axes#Terminology)?
As to your actual question, the answer depends on your definition of a sentence. Of which there are dozens. And you can easily come up with a dozen more. If you define a sentence as "anything beginning with a capital letter and ending in a period", then obviously your fragment is one sentence. If you define a sentence as "a syntactically complete thought", then your fragment is obviously two sentences. So the question becomes: why do you even care? What difference does it make? Let's say I tell you you have three and a half sentences there. Now what?
Just wondering - what do you get when you feed the paragraph back to grammarly's grammar checker?

Sticking "everyday" in the middle would make that the least important.  If the schedule is the key: Everyday, I go to school by bus.  If the transportation is key: I take the bus to school everyday.
From the title, I thought you were referring to Toyotas.  :-)  Can you clarify the other contexts (an example or two)?
I'm not understanding the context of the question (the way you want to use recalled).  The term means "brought back".  Memory is an internal mental process.  Bringing back an object is an external physical process.  Recalling a car generally refers to a request to return it rather than the action of bringing it back.  I'm having trouble visualizing how you want to use it.  Can you give an example, maybe a sentence?
How would you use that verb in a sentence? E.g. [edit] your question to insert something like the following: "If you want to (view forecasts at a higher precision), please click on the place of interest."

Something like [epicurean](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/epicurean)?
This isn't clear. You seem to say you want to live life fully (which is vague but I understand to mean 'filled with activity' or 'lots of interesting things', but then your sentence mentions 'losing less time' which sounds more like optimizing use of time. Those don't sound like the same things to me (though they overlap). Do you want efficient use of time, or do you want extraordinary things to happen?

Perhaps, **"Are you sh--ting me?!"** (more vulgar and emphatic version of "Are you kidding me?")
The question is too broad. And primarily opinion-based. Not to mention that a riposte to such a statement is generally misguided. The point of the statement is to request that both parties *stop* with the rejoinders. If you need to keep riposting then you haven't gotten the message, methinks. It is difficult to productively argue with someone who does not want to argue with you. Or are you perhaps just looking for the last word? (You can tell that I do *not* think of such a statement as a "*rhetorical weapon*". I don't see it being used that way.)
If you want to keep the adverbs rather than use phrases like "from a ... point of view/perspective", I'd suggest using em dashes: "As we can see nuclear power is -- economically, socially, morally and sustainably -- the most viable source of energy." (By the way, wouldn't "environmentally" be more suitable than "sustainably"? We don't tend to find "sustainably" as an independent, isolated adverb, do we?)
_Is your company's official **headquarters** still Helsinki?_
When translating, rather than working word for word, it is better to focus on the meaning, and then allow that meaning to express itself naturally in the target language.  With this approach, I suggest: "Is your company still officially located in Helsinki?"
The idiom means something like, 'in a good condition, (often after having been in a less good state)'. http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/right+as+rain Do you seek an idiom for 'in a poor state, (potentially having been in a better one)', or on that means 'incorrect'?

Yes: the fronting of an adverb does not prevent subject-auxiliary inversion occurring in this kind of interrogative. But are you sure you meant the second sentence to be an interrogative? (You've added a question mark).

Thanks for clarifying. Why doesn't the word *strangers* work in your report, and what nuance or connotation etc do you want the new word or phrase to carry?
You could say ".....six other students, who I knew only slightly."    This raises another question:  how well did the six know each other before you joined the group?
Your question implies that being put in a group with six strangers had some sort of effect on your work.  Did the six all knew each other well, and you came to the group as an outsider, or were all seven of you strangers, near strangers or at most slight acquaintances?   Do you have a question beyond an English question --- one for the Academic or Workplace site?

Can you not find a way to explain the meaning of the 'official' names in your text? I would never guess 'fear of the dead' or 'of pain' from 'monstrophobic'. Not all fears are phobias. It would be helpful if you loosed at the Single-word-request tag info and formulated your question as it suggests, including an example sentence and your research.
Your paragraph about the girl would benefit from some editing. At present I don't find it all all clear. You've said monster are dead people, yes? but 'a girl (afraid of the dead) protects nonviolent *dead people* ripped off their humanity from the atrocious humans, which are prepared to do anything not to become *dead people* they once were' is confusing in the extreme.
@Syk Sorry for the delay in answering. Problems included: I don't know what 'ripped off their humanity' means. Who ripped humanity off who? How do you even rip humanity off something? Did you mean 'stripped *of*'? 'Ripped off' means something different. I don't know what you mean by 'which are prepared to do anything not become monsters they once were' Who used to be monsters? If monsters are dead people how can that be something someone **used** to be. It needs editing because you are not communicating the story elements understandably.
As it’s spelled?? So it should sound like ***fury***??
I usually would use "I guess I shouldn't have done that" or perhaps more formally "I suppose x was the wrong thing to do"  but that would imply I had some doubt if I was wrong. If you know you're wrong I think just saying "You were right, I should have gone to the store sooner" still would ask for confirmation without seeming like you have any doubt .... But perhaps you're looking for something else. "Shouldn't have I?" certainly sounds like you're still doubting what you should have done by asking so clearly for a confirmation.
Possibly *irrevocable moment*, or *point of no return*?

Can you clarify the usage a bit, in your paragraph about the girl you tell us  that she is expressionless etc, but not how this relates to her moving from the couch to the window.

I'm not really seeing the relationship between her changed state and changed location, or indeed what the change in her state *is*.

It may help for you to explain the link between your boredom and the work. For example, is the work *causing* you to be bored? If the work wasn't there, would you be bored anyway (i.e. you were already bored - the fact that there's lots to do is irrelevant)? When you say *bored*, are you board of the work, or is it used as a synonym for a medical condition such as ADD/ADHD?

Does garden chair, in your example, mean "a chair made of garden" or "a chair in the garden" or "a chair for use with a garden" or "a chair for use by a garden" or something else? Normally, it would mean "a chair used in the garden", so "garden" is an adjective, not a possessive.
What does one call an elevator when it goes down?  It is still an "elevator".  For that matter, what do you call stairs (you can go up or down them).  If you have a pair of staircases, one designated up and one down, you might differentiate the "down" staircase.  But you would do it by adding a clarifying label, there isn't a different term.
D on the piano is real simple: only two black keys. Mimi's aria from "La Boheme" is sung in Di. That said, are you looking to describe the instrument's sound or layout and tuning? I mean, the word "endemic" springs to mind, as well as "native," but I get a feeling you want something more specific.
In the context of *Is your name Jane? Yes, **it is,*** the respondent's ***it*** refers to ***your name***. If the reply is *Yes, **that's** right,* it's ***that** "answer"* (the one you put forward as a possibility) which/that is correct. I don't really see anything confusing about the referent of ***it*** there. Pity us older Brits though - we have to deal with much worse stuff, ***innit**?*
What framed the glass as the referent of *it* in that sentence? *Something earlier in the conversation* (or otherwise contextually obvious). But it isn't a matter of absolute/binary categorisation. Consider *It is so* as a response to *Life's a bitch*. I'd say it's effectively a matter of opinion / intention there as to whether ***it*** refers to ***life***, or to ***that statement***.
@Kika Do you want to translate it into a specific idiomatic Greek sentence, or do you just want to convey the meaning? The English idiom does not imply any reasons, it comes close to _δεν υπάρχει περίπτωση που θα ειχαμε σχέση_ or _με τίποτα θα ειχαμε σχέση εμείς_

Several (most?) American styles license putting the new capital letter in brackets: "[H]ave the validity etc." This is standard for US legal citation, for example. Use only when the partial quotation begins a sentence, otherwise just include the partial quotation as originally capitalized, eg. *According to Jones, most quotations "have the validity etc."* In this case, the lack of a capital letter signals that you have begun the quotation partway through. But of course, check with your particular style manual.

Can you clarify if the emphasis in the proverb is on "burn", or on "together"? For example, if they burned separately (or in your example, if the the perpetrators were punished separately/differently but everyone was still punished), would the proverb still apply? It's actually not clear to me in Farsi either; the version I was familiar with omitted the "Where there's fire" part, so to me the emphasis to me was on "together", whereas in your version, the emphasis is on "burn" (as opposed to "not burn").

It would probably help to give a few more details, if you have them. Are you thinking of a situation with a non-native speaker, or a native speaker? Either can show mixed accents, but with native speakers, another possible explanation aside from mixing that may be likely is that the accent simply developed naturally to be intermediate to other more well-known accents.

Out of curiosity: can you please add a comment with links to some examples of the word *pendant* used in the sense of *terminology*? Thanks.
Did you do any independent research? I mean, I hate to sound rude, but if you google "define satiate", it literally brings up "another term for sate".
Every is a distributive determiner as reflected by the fact that it selects a singular 'head', hence "Every student is here", not *"Every students are here". "Cell phone" has singular "phone" as head, so singular tag "doesn't it?" is the one you want; (note that you can say "All the cell phones do that, don't they?)
It's a play on the idiom "an elephant in the room," which is an important topic or issue that people are keen to ignore. The advice to "Don't mention the elephant in the room" will mean something like, "Don't mention the obvious thing that everyone knows is problem, because we're all trying to ignore the fact that it's a problem... and we don't want you to bring up the fact that we're ignoring it." This joke is funny(?) because the friend gives you an elephant and then says "don't mention it," in the sense of "No problem for the gift" but also in the sense of the literal elephant in the room.

This one is still escaping me.  On something like a pouch made from a sheet of paper or plastic film, the material is formed into a tube, which is flattened into a pouch,  and then the top and bottom of the tube are sealed to hold the contents.  Where the sides were joined to form the tube, it is often sealed a short distance from the edge.  The material between the seal and the edge becomes a flap that is folded flat against the pouch, usually running down the back of the pouch.  Is that flap the part you're referring to?

This is not a question about English for which there can be an answer, it is one of  the “…types of questions should I avoid asking?” in the Help Centre in the category:  ‘there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.’”.

Thinking on this more, I actually think you would get a much better answer if you researched your possible solutions, then posted this on stack overflow.

That is something a programmer would be better at answering I think.

On the contrary: it should not be used because it does not sound natural to a native speaker. _Upsurge_ is "an upward surge in the strength or quantity of something; an increase." Could you apply quantity to "improvement"? Not really.

I wouldn't worry that you sounded like an idiot—if you haven't been getting a lot of "*Huh?*"s and "*Sorry, what?*"s you were probably understood just fine, and just sounded quaint or cosmopolitan, depending on the attitude of the listener.

Hmmm,  I like this feeling myself :) However I don't feel superior to any one particular person... I feel superior to a more common behavior.

As intuitive as juice. Etc...

Can you use sense #2 in a sentence? If someone said, "I can't solve this puzzle. Can you help?" and the response was "Sure, I'll take a gander at it," then that is still using sense #1. The person is just offering to take a look at the puzzle.

I think the question identified by Araucaria seems of reasonable scope but I notice that it doesn't mention phonemes. Would you be OK with editing out the reference to phonemes in the earlier part of your answer? I think that would make the question more focused; phonemes don't really have much to do with any of the other things this question is about. You can always ask a separate question about phonemes (probably it would be best to first read [What, precisely, is a phoneme?](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/15753) on the Linguistics Stack Exchange site).

Is there anything in the context to indicate what progress was expected, and why the actual progress was therefore surprising? _Immense_ on the other hand fits right in with the semantics of the sentence: _despite_ tells us there is an antithesis between the two parts of the sentence. If the progress would have been "normal" or "little", we would probably not suspect the questions to be answered, so there would not be any antithesis.

It's certainly entirely grammatical for "is" to be followed by a plural noun. An old question about this topic: [Agreement in “(Singular Noun) Is/Are (Plural Noun)”?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/17766) Verb agreement should be based only on the subject of the sentence, not on any other non-subject noun phrases. You can figure out which phrase is the subject by using the usual rules of thumb related to position and meaning.
Have a look at the section titled [Why do we use inversion and fronting?](http://random-idea-english.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/exploring-inversion-and-fronting.html) Taken in isolation I can't see any particular nuance imparted by your cited example, but if you consider it in the full context, I suppose it's possible your fronted clause is being used *as a cohesive device to link a clause or sentence to what has just gone before* (one of 3 specific possibilities covered there). But most likely it's just a "meaningless" random stylistic choice.

Welcome to EL&U. This is not a discussion forum, but a Q&A that seeks to provide definitive answers to specific questions, and it's not clear what your question is (invitations to discussion or opinion— like "any thoughts?"— are not permitted). Words like *sanction* or *trim* that have opposing meanings are known as *contronyms*, *auto-antonyms*, or *antagonyms* among other things, and you may wish to try a web search on these terms to develop the question. I strongly encourage you to take the site [tour] and review the [help] for additional guidance.

Words can be pronounced in all kinds of ways in combination with each other. The dictionary just describes the basic pronunciation of a word, and maybe a few common variants: it won't tell you all of the ways it can change depending on the surrounding words. You are probably just hearing non-phonemic devoicing of the word-final "lenis" obstruent /v/ before a voiceless consonant (/k/), as described in the answer to [Are “whores” and “horse” homophones?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/342273) This is a type of o a native speaker, this generally still sounds like /v/, not /f/.

I'm not wild about the orthography myself, but you can't really argue with the dictionary: [**stymy**](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/stymy) *Past participle: **stymied** Gerund: **stymying***. Admittedly, we usually spell the base form [***stymie***](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/stymie), but that simply can't work with the ***ing*** suffix.
Are you simply trying to figure out some "rule" that allows you to "know" how to change the spelling of the base form of a verb when forming its regular *-ing* inflection without having to look it up? I don't see anything here about grammar, just writing. Or are you asking not about the writing but about the pronunciation? All *-ing* inflections are perfectly phonologically regular.

Ignoring the additional problems with that sentence, the use of "people" there is largely superfluous anyway: who else are you likely to be asserting things to, your dog?

1. is correct. The expression "where the above identity comes from" is a subordinate interrogative clause (embedded question) functioning as complement of "out". Subordinate interrogative do not (normally) have subject-auxiliary inversion and hence 2., which does have inversion, is incorrect. The meaning is "I can't figure out the answer to the question 'Where does the above identity come from?"'.
Would 'corresponds with' suit your meaning better, rather than 'paralleling'?
I'm a little confused by your groups. Am I right in thinking that you mean something like this? Group one consists of men and women wearing black, group two consists of men and women wearing blue, and in each group there are five men and six women. That is the number of men and the number of women in each group are the same, the colour of their clothes determines the group each individual belongs to and their gender determines the sub-group they belong to.

Are you asking about "regular" English or gender identity English?  In regular English, you're still talking about Bob and his actual gender doesn't change, so it would be "he".  In gender identity English, it would be the gender-neutral "they", regardless of the actual or hypothetical situation, although Bob would be free to refer to himself as "she".  Now if you'll excuse me, my brain is going to explode.  :-)
Are you asking about the hypothetical situation such as "If Bob were a girl he/she would run with his/her hips and elbows swinging"; or is it more like a real-life situation like "If Bob were a girl that knock in the groin would not hurt him so much"? Or sumpin like that?

The phrase "*open up about yourself*" in that context communicates your intent. What's the connection you're trying to draw between that and the two other words you're asking about? If you're not trying to draw a connection there, it (*cf* combining words) should be asked as another question, including background etc as you have nicely done for this question. It would help, though, if you could explain why you feel that "open up" isn't a "meaningful" expression of the idea you're trying to communicate.

The word "bog" is used in English slang to refer to a toilet because it was originally used to refer to a "British or German [standard of]" motorcycle, and then wheel and then round opening for a toilet. Perhaps six has a similar origin?
Just a suggestion, does a possible similarity of sound between "six" and "cess"; particularly in a languid 19th century upper class drawl or even a mock Irish accent, have anything to do with it? I include the mock Irish because the curse "Bad cess to ye" appears to have been a curse in 19th century Ireland from some versions of the traditional song Black Velvet Band. This might even explain the Welsh version.

I'm using brackets here just to highlight the difference between the two. Note that replacing *happy* with *delightful* sounds fine.
When a bird is curious or wary, it moves its head about quickly, almost jerkily. - the way I read it a few decades ago, the eyes of (some kinds of?) birds are special and they actually *need* to actively move the head to be able to see static, non-moving stuff.

Is this a sentence of your own devising, or did you come across it somewhere in particular? If that latter, could you please tell us where you found it? I ask because I share some of your unease with the sentence as it is currently worded, although I can't quite put my finger on why it strikes me as a little peculiar. Because you can have *some scheduled interruptions* (or unscheduled ones), that shows that *scheduled* ***can** can act as an normal adjective in the noun phrase, which is one test for a predicate adjective construction. But you can schedule somebody for an 8am procedure, too.
Just speculating here, but is it linked to 'a glint' in one's eyes (which is similar to your meaning), referring to the shine?
Shakespeare might've written *could I do this, I would do it* in the same way that we still write *had I done this, I would've done it* or *were I able, I would be able,* but this "subjunctive inversion" or whatever it's called has nothing to do with *but*.

 so was hoping to get some money early There is some discussion as to whether this is a question or not. A more clear example: "I wonder if you will give me some money". Grammatically, not a question. However, there is  difference to saying it normally (statement of your wonder), and using inflection _as if you were asking a question_ (which makes it a polite question, more than a statement). Since the way you say it changes its interpretation, you can argue that that functionally makes it a question. Similarly, "Can I go home?" asks for **permission**, rather than stating the **ability** to
What research have you done?  Also your ending question has got to be primarily opinion based.
As far as grammar is concerned, absolutely any two words that are the same part of speech are interchangeable in absolutely any sentence. It is quite obvious that the result will always be grammatical, though most of the time it will be entirely nonsensical. Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. So you can't be asking about grammar alone. But if we drag meaning into this, then absolutely no two words are always interchangeable. No two words at all. In no language at all. That's why they are two words and not one. Again, this is obvious. So what exactly is the question here?

Similar to is adjectival, and so "Similar to [1], we" means literally that "we are similar to [1]." Surely not the intended meaning."Similarly to [noun]" sounds quite unidiomatic to my ears. Are these math papers you see written by native English speakers? More idiomatic to my ears is, for example, the adverbial phrase "as in." In fact, an Ngram comparison for A. "as in equation" vs. B. "similarly to equation" shows version A to be about 100 times more common. And these are examples in science textbooks, not informal language. So, as in Question 2 linked above, I also here suggest "as in."

Wait...are you asking about a word for a 'list with a single item'? Your second 'meaning' isn't clear or is it is, isn't clearly different from the first _or_ clearly not what people think of as itemization.
@raiph OK. Are you describing the operation on two things A and B (A must be a list) and however many items A has (let's call it n), you're adding on B to the end of list A making a new list with n+1 items? And B, whether it is a list itself or not, is simply treated as a new object, the one at the end of this new list? If so, then this operation is called 'appending'.
@raiph Clearer and not clearer. Are you devising this operation yourself or are you actually reading a particular programming languages docs? Maybe you should look at docs for a list programming language (like Scheme or Mathematica or Python) and see words they use.  'Itemizing' is not a common technical programming operation. You can 'list' all the elements of a list. You can 'concatenate' two lists to get a list whose elements are the elts of the first followed by the elts of the second. You can 'append' (I described already). You can 'create' a new list whose two elements are the two lists.
I'm super confused now. After all that explanation and editing to reflect, is it right that you've edited the question _back_ to making a single element out of a list? And making a list of length 2 out of 2 lists is _not_ what you want covered by the word you are seeking?

I am personally having trouble understanding what it is you mean... You're looking for one word that simultaneously means helps, educates and moves the project forward?
It sounds like you're suggesting something along the lines of *mutually beneficial*. Am I on the right track?
Why are you restricted to a noun? There are many ways of saying this, but virtually all of them rely on an adjective or verb rather than noun.
There is a single word for 'that which is protected or guarded by a protector or guard'. It is their 'charge'. Whether you can use that will depend on the details of your programming concept. For example, if you have a class or interface called 'custodian', it might be OK to give it a property called 'charge'. But the word 'charge' has so many uses that it might equally be very confusing. Can you provide a little bit more info about your technical concept? Do you have a generic word for the 'guard' which guards the thing in question, for example?
Okay, interesting question. What does the title have to do with anything? No ballas here.
Welcome, Jason. Could you please tell us if you have done any preliminary research, namely looking up these three words in a dictionary? If you have, you should summarize what you found and what you still don't understand. Please see [this topic](https://english.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) at the Help Center.
Can you give us an example sentence showing how you want to use the word? That's technically required for single-word-requests, and will help us give you the nuance that you want. Off the top of my head I can think of ***antediluvian, eternal, timeless, immemorial***, etc. Doing some research digging of your own with a dictionary or thesaurus, and telling us what you've found and why that doesn't work, is also very helpful.

*care not thou* is ungrammatical. Are you sure you’ve transcribed it properly?
With smells you need to be more specific; e.g. with food you can use words like *aroma*. Verbs like *waft* are helpful, including with perfumes. Not sure about tarmac though. What is it that smells? Is it a vapour? You could perhaps say something like "With a faint waft of tarmac vapour caressing one's nostrils..."

Was torture *doing* the forcing? Or was torture used to force?
I guess it would be 'looking suspiciously' (at something). The sentence seems incomplete - can't you include a description of the activity?

I remember long ago on the TV series "Upstairs Downstairs" when Mrs Bridges (the cook)  said the word ... I just assume is was with a *P* sound in there, but an alternate pronunciation of "recipe" ra-SEEP.  But maybe it was "receipt"?
In my family we say things like *Shall I fetch the Stanley [knife]?* if someone's vociferously bewailing their bad situation (alluding to the idea of offering someone an ultra-sharp blade so they can cut their own throat and spare the rest of us having to listen to the constant whingeing). But we're a bit of an oddball family, and I doubt our whimsical turn of phrase would count as an "idiom".
Not quite as far (or self-inflicted) as 'kick the bucket'?
There are no exact synonyms. This means that synonymy i snot an equivalence relation. This means that if B is a synonym of A, and C is a synonym of B, you can't always replace A with C. (sometimes you can but not always). So, no, You can't say 'She took labour home with her.', that just sounds weird, right?

You are Russian, right? Have you ever heard of [terminal devoicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final-obstruent_devoicing#Russian)? If yes, when did you first do? Do your fellow native speakers know it? — German features terminal devoicing as well but few speakers are actually aware of it, let alone know the name for it. Germans also never start a word with a vowel, but a [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop) without being aware of it. Those are two of the key features of a German accent in other languages – just like diphthongs are a key feature of an English accent.

In the literature of the time, I have never come across "flapper" as meaning young prostitute. But if that was its slang meaning in 1893, I wonder how that came about? If it was derived from the female anatomy, it seems too crude to have made that transition to the liberated young women of the 20s.
The best answer is "Who the **** wrote this stupid test and what the **** were they thinking??".  :-)  Seriously, it's a junk question.

This type of word coalescing depends heavily on whether a syllable is stressed or not. "What did you DO?" becomes "What [dɪʤu] DO?" or even "What [dɪʤə] DO?" However, "I did the right thing, but what did YOU do?" or "If you didn't do x, what DID you do?" stays as [dɪd ju]. Same with "but yeah": "But YEAH, you're RIGHT" never becomes [bətʃə]. However, "But yeah RIGHT, like he would ever do that" does become [bətʃə]. Same with any other combo of this sort--when it comes to slurring words together, it happens when those syllables are unstressed.
@WS2 Is it worth sticking a british-english tag on this since the US differentiates differently and doesn't apparently use 'gammon'?
Can you explain a bit more about the motivation for this question? Are you asking about how to say it, or about how to hyphenate it? Are you a non-native speaker trying to acquire correct pronunciation, or a native speaker trying to understand the theoretical concept of syllabification?

Did you mean "Toxic combinations" in your title? I don't see "Toxic appropriation" in the image. Also, you should probably add more context—at a minimum, include the text of the advertisement for those who can't see the image, and preferably also say more about your discomfort. Is this based on technical IT security usage, or something more general?
I find periods more confusing here when the equation is supposed to end the sentence. Do you put the period at the end of the equation? That seems like it would get in the way.
Are you asking if people call out for a person with a profession name, similar to calling out for a nurse by saying 'Sister!' or are you asking if there are other _religious_ labels that are used for calling for people by profession in secular settings?
I'm interested in hearing the answer to this. Thank you. Also, curious why you consider it a slang term?
Is that the main definition of the term? I thought it had at least as much to do with a fortunate outcome as the effort needed for such an outcome (it's an idiom based on the luck of the draw, after all).

@sheidaei - no, I don’t think it makes sense for unpleasant situation in the past.  Although honestly I don’t even understand your intention with that setup.  Are you asking them how they feel about it now or what they think about it now or whether they have come to grips with it now?
@Sasan Did you follow through with any off the actual search results? Many are false positives eg picking up the ends of two sentences eg "Now, be honest!" Lie 2 "No, I didn't do it." or refer to really intentional lies, the opposite of your accidental misinformation. *Where* is it you hear this usage? What country? It may be a term familiar to your local English that is not current elsewhere.
Why would those definitions be mutually exclusive? If you love somebody, I would assume you think they are important.
Why are you omitting the third meaning that is listed? It fits your case as well: _"care to do something, to make the effort to do something"_. Also, the presence of the earlier word "**compassion**" (in your snippet) should give you a hint.

@user58712 how about that?  I don't understand your point.  The words "get over here" without context as part of a larger sentence may or may not be in the imperative voice, but that doesn't shed any light on the topic because, for example, an infinitive phrase also has no omitted subject, because it's in the infinitive.  Infinitives also require *to* in some contexts and are required not to have it in others.  That doesn't make its omission a shortcut.

Are you a feminist (or supporter thereof)? Assuming it's mere "happenstance" that you're the only female in a group of males (or the only *male* in a group of *females*) it's not necessarily a good idea to call attention to the gender bias, just as you might not wish to use subtle tricks of language to call attention to the fact that one person in a group happens to be of a different race / religion / sexual orientation to all the others. Unless you're being deliberately facetious, I'd avoid it.

What is the context for and the meaning behind this idiom you’re looking for?   I immediately thought it would be “someone asking you to do something and you hinting at what you need from them first.” but others have offered options for  “utterances of acquiescence”, or “utterances of praise”.
Given your audience, a technical term like int64 is appropriate. Why invent a word when there's a known reference that identifies what you want, maps to the computer's architecture, and is referenced in other sources for decades?
@Fructibus Out of curiosity: where did you first ask the question? The migration note only notes Latin.SE and the edit trail only notes migration to English.SE. By the way, I agree with Sam and Draconis that the English plural would likely be *Anteds*, following the usual formation of plurals from names.
Neither tail hit or tail strike are commonly used phrases.  So to better answer your question, can you provide an example sentence?  I do not know if there is a definitive answer to your question.  It will depend on the person speaking and the exact situation they are describing.
It would be helpful if you would clarify which meaning of "flew over everyone's head" you mean. Do you mean that a physical object, like a bird or airplane, actually passed through the air over their heads? (In that case it would be, "It flew over everyone's heads." Heads plural.) Or do you mean that the listeners failed to comprehend what the speaker was trying to communicate to them? (In that case, the usual idiom would be "It *went* over everyone's head." Head in the singular.)
This is unclear. Are you copying a row and then modifying it? 'copy' may be better than 'mirror'; the latter implies it is identical to the source and will never be changed. 'copy' would allow further modifications.

Of course it is, why not? As long as the question can stand by itself and be understood without the video, adding external references is fine.

You've translated the sentence, but you identify it as a *saying*. As a *saying*, how and when is it used? Then perhaps we can identify an English equivalent rather than just giving a literal translation.

Isn't "what d'you say" a contraction of "what *do* you say", as in, "Let's go for ice cream, what d'you say?"
do you mean "knitted goods"? Is it a window or a platform? Loading platform or loading dock come to mind. Window in English implies a hole in the wall of a building or a partition. Delivery window, if it is indeed a window.
Things coming off production lines are not stores, even in Britain. They are output or production or widgets. As I asked and was not given an answer about, is this really a WINDOW or is it a platform?? I would be most surprised if this were an actual window. It's items ON pallets. What is the actual movement? Conveyor belt to pallet to? Pallets usually sit on the floor or loading dock. No windows. Loading docks have roll-up doors.
Could  you provide an example?  Or two?
Racial' means having to do with race. 'Racialized' means made to be something having to do with race. 'A racial minority' means a minority that is so because of race. 'A racialized minority' just doesn't sound right semantically. A minority is probably so not by choice and not by external changing factors (though one can certainly make a long term case to make sense out of that). How do you racialize a minority? People slowly realize that a subgroup is recognized because of race? Where are you seeing 'racialized minority'? Can you give a link?
All of the previous sentences are fine, But I'm struggling to understand what you are saying here. Do you mean "By whom did Jack get followed/marked/eaten/killed?" i.e. "Who followed Jack?" .You would be better off on English Language Learners with this type of question.

While this might make sense to someone fluent in computer code, it makes little sense in English.  "Rely" idiomatically requires a prepositional phrase, "on ____".  Rather than prompting a yes or no response, you may get "What??"

So after counting out instances of the two words without regard to context (Ngrams) and quoting three randomly chosen examples of sentences using "after" from the vast reaches of the interweb, you're asking if the two words are synonyms? I'm just trying to be clear.  Noting that the words are close enough that they bear little difference to any but the most sensitive and nuanced eye, I'm left wondering why it matters?  The sample sentences look grammatically sound, if debatable on sylistic merit.
Could you please add some examples from published works that you feel are at odds with the rule you learned? ¶ By the way,  a compound-anything has two or more anythings. Therefore a compound sentence has two or more sentences (independent clauses) to it. You seem to have confused compound sentences and perhaps complex sentences (which are something else) with compound verbs. A sentence where a single subject governs more than verb is still a simple sentence, not a compound or complex one. It just has a compound predicate, which isn't enough to make something a compound sentence on its own.
Would you say that *brassiere* is spelled with a double *s*? It's not unusual to use *double* like this, as has been done for many centuries before the invention of bras (checking OED at least since 1599).

I read your sentence as meaning 'I laughed so hard that my parents became mad at me (for laughing so hard)' - which seems like an unlikely scenario.

Could you define what you in particular mean by "social justice" ?
Avoid asking for help writing (or proofreading). “How should I write this?”, “is this correct?”, and “which is correct?” questions are out of scope and your question may be removed. See: “[What topics can I ask about here? - Help Center](/help/on-topic)”. If there is an unstated specific concern, such as “What does (word) mean in context?” or “How does (grammar or punctuation rule) apply in context?” ask that question instead. Also check out “[Where can I ask for free proofreading? – Meta](https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7571)”
Knee pit? You mean the back of the knee? "To slip the pillow out from under her knee". A two-word verb followed by a prepositional phrase.
While not the same meaning, I've heard "reach me down" in the American south in the sense of retrieving something too high to reach for someone else. "Be a dear and reach me down that jar of pickled okra?"

The intention of the room is unclear. A room is closed or has limited access through doors. In a warehouse, are you sure you're not talking about an area of the warehouse where these goods are placed? Also, is this room (or area) a place to put goods temporarily for a an hour or a day as one stage/one planned part of a longer shipping process, or for a few weeks until requested by some other independent process?
receiving area' which is probably near the 'loading dock', if the shipping vehicles (trucks, trains, container ships) are dropping off things. But it sounds like you might want the name of the area for packages/pallets/containers to be placed _before_ they're put on the vehicles for transportation. Which one is it, the place after dropping things off, or the place for before they are shipped?

The first part of your sentence could be tightened, I think. I see where you want to go, but rather than _shaped the outlines_, how about simply _outlined, gave contour to,_ or even _gave direction to_?
The Oxford English Dictionary is very useful for questions like this. (Maybe you have free access to the online OED through your local or school library?) The answer is yes, all of the oldest senses of "start" have to do with **sudden** movement or change. The meaning "begin" came much later.

The 'title' & the original wording of the Q. gave me the impression that I needed to know about the person being mentioned and his "type of joke" in order to understand the Q.. That actually put me off even reading the rest of the Q.. Yes, I could have looked up the names & links, but I wouldn't expect to have to do that to understand the gist of a Q.. @Vun-HughVaw - If, as you now say, "the fact that he's Stephen Colbert isn't even inherently relevant to the question", why refer to him both in the 'title' and in the first 6 words?
The definition of the word 'word' is contentious. 'hmm' and 'mmm' are very near the border. (I consider them on the other side of wordness). Whatever it is, the rules are unclear. If 'mmm' is a word, then why isn't 'mmmm' and 'mmmmm' etc?

I can't come up with any logical or instructional meaning that might be intended by your *then one of them must be non-empty* example, regardless of punctuation. The only possible meanings of ***then*** I can imagine are 1) ***after** complying with the first instruction (making the assumption that there are two sets), **the next thing** to do is (that you must ensure one is non-empty),* or 2) ***because** you made the assumption that there are two sets, **it logically follows that** one is non-empty*. Neither seem like meaningful things to say, so what *do* you mean?

What's the context? Are you literally talking about the Greek letter alpha (in a sentence like, "The Greek word for 'wood' contains two alphas"), or are you talking about something commonly denoted with that letter (in a sentence like, "The two wheels have the same angular velocity at time zero, but different angular accelerations")?

Sorry but I do not understand this statement: "terms that describe easily recognizable spoken words". What do you mean by "easily recognizable spoken words"?? If I say "cat" and then write it, is the written word cat easily recognizable? When you say words are easy to hear (over a radio system for example) that is not the same as  hearing a person speak in person. Radio transmissions (airplanes) would tend to blur certain sounds more than others. I think the fields here are: acoustics and natural language processing and recognition.

The whole point of the hyphens is to reduce ambiguity. Whether or not a phrase is hyphenated when on its own is completely beside the point. *Most every* phrase is not hyphenated when on its own, but you add hyphens when using it as a compound modifier. Just take your phrase and ask yourself, how do you want the reader to parse it? Then make them parse it that way by using hyphens. Do you want them to parse it as something about the post? Something after birth? Or something after birth control? Ah, and so there's your answer.
By your use of the definite article, are you distinguishing between 'the great' (intensified by capitalisation to 'the Great') Britain and 'Great Britain'? I'm not sure that Americans as a whole think of Britain with such deference.

Avoid writing advice requests. Such questions may be closed. See: “[What topics can I ask about here?](/help/on-topic)”. Subjective questions are off topic unless the request is expert-level, unique, particularly interesting and thought-provoking, shows substantial effort and research, and demands responses that meet the same standards.

Why not cover all bases by converting *both* elements to active voice?  *People had often told me that a genie haunted the rock before me.*
a rock haunted by a genie sounds very odd to me. A genie might be in a rock, possibly. Also, rock before me? The rock in front of me.
FumbleFingers' sentence is good. I would not say before me, though. We rarely say before me for in front me unless there is a reason for it: formality, literary style. Shakespeare's MacBeth said it: "Is this a dagger which I see before me?"
Please explain what you mean for something to “be” a word. It’s not a ham sandwich, you know, so it rather looks like a word to me. The OED always gives all historical spellings for a word, even from before we had standardized spellings. So for example [this one](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/130193) was sometimes spelled *accoranse* back in the 1500s, as well as *accurauntes* for the plural. Does that mean those “are” “words” for your purposes?
Look at the definition of epithet in [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epithet).  Now look at the definition of moniker in [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moniker).  Ditto sobriquet in [M-W](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sobriquet).  Put these definitions in your Q, and explain just what puzzles you, and you could have a good question.  For example, is sobriquet just a more sophisticated word for moniker?
Surely it should be "He **does**, and so **do** Ryan and McConnell". You're correct that "Ryan and McConnell" takes the third person plural. (Or should that be "**take**"...?)
What are you trying to emphasise? As written, the sentence makes four separate points: when MB Kit Systems was founded, where, what they make, and how widely applicable are their products. That is quite a lot for one sentence. I suggest you start with a sentence that makes your main point, and then write another sentence or two with the subsidiary points.
Would a prefixed word meaning 'related' work? Not sure if there will be a *single* word...
Could you give a bit more context? What type of document is the original text (e.g. instruction manual, nonfiction book, fiction), and is there some reason for preferring to spell out the numbers rather than writing them exactly as "2017-976"?
How numbers are spelled out differs from person to person and place to place. A Yank might pronounce a phone extension of 5336 as *fifty-three thirty-six* but a Brit would probably not, and might say something like *five double-three six* which would sound utterly bizarre to the American. What locale are you interested in?
How would you pronounce *condor*? The  CMU Pronouncing dictionary you linked to shows it using the same sound as *doctor*, but howjsay.com and I both pronounce it like we would *guarantor*, not *doctor* ([condor](http://howjsay.com/index word=condor&x=0&y=0&  1920&flash=n), [doctor](http://howjsay.com/index word=doctor&x=0&y=0&  1920&flash=n)).
Do you have a preferred register? That is, would a slang term work, or are you specifically looking for something more formal? Also, do you specifically want an adjective?
Can you tell us or link to the source of your sentence? The word 'experience' seems wrong.
It's unclear what you're asking. The correct technical  term for this is "property" or "attribute" despite your not liking those terms. Do you mean some attributes and not others? How do you make the distinction? Finally, what do you consider a "summary" of something that can't be measured?
I think this question could still use some heavy-duty editing. The first half of it (above the **Update**) _is_ a duplicate of the "What's the source" question, combined with a more basic "what does it mean?" question. The update (was there a yesteryear term for shipping, and if so, was it "matchmaking"?) is a different question. But combined, the two halves make a mishmash of a question.
What makes you think anybody ever uses this? Who do you expect will know this word?
The Koine original uses a present participle and substantivized adjective, all with a neuter article and endings. You can see the struggle to get that construction into English suitable for public proclamation. Cf. KJV: what woman would be pleased to hear, angel or no, that she's about to bear a _thing_?  See https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/31903/is-the-kjv-wording-holy-thing-wrong-in-luke-135 but only the chosen answer.
If  |She was [locking the door]. [participle]|, is a subject-less clause, then you have two clauses in that sentence? Is that right?  I think that's nuts. How does that compare to: |She was locking the door while the car idled in the garage.|??
@JK2 According to your analysis of the utterance, there are two clauses, but what of my add-on? That would then make it three according to what  you say which is clearly an absurdity. I don't think there is a "subject-less clause"....and  I am surprised no one has pointed that out.....what am I missing?? "She was locking the door" is a single sentence (utterance). My add-on makes it have two clauses.
I edited to bold the infinitives/participles as well, as I find it easier to compare the sentences that way (but feel free to change it back if you disagree). One thing I noticed when doing that is that you actually changed the example sentence: Hewings has 'You should **have** contacted me earlier.' as the direct statement, not 'You should contact me earlier.' Are there any examples that just have *should* in Hewings?

If a shop offers a finance product it will, almost certainly, have a company-specific name for it. The most general way of asking the question is either "can I put this on finance?" or "can I spread the cost of this?"
1563?! That sounds really late to be the earliest example. What about Chaucer: "Mordre wol out, certeyn, it wol nat faille" (will here is a "modal auxiliary expressing certainty, sureness, or fatefulness").

Although I probably wouldn't say it that way, "I was sat at our table at Nando's" makes sense to me because in restaurants hosts typically "seat" guests. An American would likely say "I stood / was standing on stage" and "I sat / was sitting at our table." The one that really throws me, is "I was stood on stage." Do you have a link to that usage? I don't dispute it necessarily, but I don't remember ever hearing it.
If it is not used, why do you think it is not used? If you look at a collocation dictionary, for instance [oxford](http://oxforddictionary.so8848.com/search1?word=warn), you see indeed your three preopositions mentioned, but _from_ is not there. You _might_ want to get into a discussion about what "grammatically correct" means, but that would be a whole nother story...

@Danny But it _says_ 'rated'. Why would you think it's anything else?
In those times, dashes were not necessarily de rigueur. What is very comical, is giving this particular word ER status, as if it were like any other er word in English (potter, candle -stick maker) and then capitalizing it as if it had special status. At the time, capitalization was used for certain nouns to confer importance. I agree that rub off dust is slightly odd, but what other verb would you use? A wiper off of dust?  I find it charming, a rubber off of dust akin to: a spinner of tales or a marker of passages.
To give a better idea of what you mean by this open ended concept, and how an open ended concept of furniture differs from the concept of 'furniture', could you perhaps give is some example sentences?
@Ooker Well 'a drawer' is *part of a piece* of furniture, a 'chest' or 'set' of drawers is a piece of furniture, we wouldn't talk about 'a furniture'. The sets of words wouldn't work in the same way in English. Can you give us examples of how the life and time sets would be used, and edit the examples into the question?
There might be a good way to do this in English, but I think you're going to need to add some context—What sentences would you use this in?

How can it be both? You mean she divorced and then the man she was married to died? I don't think that can happen. If he first died then she can't divorce him. Or do you mean a term that means either one OR the other? Because you say "that word would imply both"
Do you have such a word for a man (widower or divorced)?

It is rather unclear what is being asked here. What exactly is meant by ‘the context of semantic signification’ in the first question?

How would 'pragmatic redundancy' work for you? There's nothing in the denotations of the words and phrases that implies immediately a redundancy, but you're pointing out that it would be silly or perverse to like bad things (though of course some silly/perverse people _do_ like bad things).

Must be the beer, what else? It can't be the legs.  It would not work here.  Because it can't be: for a couple of legs, I'll eat thee too. If he could have the beer, then he'd "eat thee too". And if he's gnawing the shins, that would include the parts of the body he would eat and probably the legs. For x in English means: In exchange for some thing, I would do some other thing.
Well, when you use foreign languages more professions than not have different names for them, but I know that isn't what you are getting at.  I also don't think you are looking for differences between British and American English but are looking for professions where we, within the same English language speaking country, respect and designate the proffesional role used in other countries ?   Perhaps "Barrister" would be used in the Wall Street journal instead of "defense attorney" or "defense counsel" if describing the occupation of a British attorney in a similar role abroad?
Imposter syndrome fits the description, however I dont think there is one correct answer for this question because it would likely depend on **why** the person in question is not seeing his/her positive attributes, is it humility to the extreme or incapability of looking one's self objectively? Is it just insecurity or somehow lacking in comparison to others (i.e. a role model). In any case I think one could say that the person has low self esteem.
The simplest explanation is that the writer didn't know the correct meaning of the expression and took it as a sign of endearment, perhaps thinking of apes picking lice from the hair of other apes, a kindly grooming process.  Or it could be a sly allusion to vigorous  fellatio. Is it a country-western or new age song?

@Gaussler What “European” feelings? The letter J represents a consonant sound not only in English but also in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Catalan, and many many others. I'm quite certain that those folks are European, and that their feelings would be hurt to say that they weren't. So I assume what you mean here is actually languages divorced from Mother Latin. :)
I would not say that "procrastination" is equivalent to "the art of doing useless things all day long"; if you want a single word, do you want it to fit "procrastination" or the thing you were asked about?
Do you mean [brand loyalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_loyalty)? I guess it's not really clear to me what "love and loyalty to a corporation" means. Is it: buying the same brand? Working for the same company, even if you could get a better offer?

Can you please provide an example of applying the tech principles in biology? Are you talking about, for example, genetic engineering, or are you (just) trying to use tech language to *describe* biological phenomena?
Can you give an example of a sentence where you would use this word?
Do you mean all things which have *ever* been known (specifically, by *humans?*) or which are *currently* known? Or indeed, all things which in principle *could* be known, even if in practice they never are?
What about the unknown knowns? Things you didn't know you knew.
Can you explain what distinguishes the areas you want to include from the areas you don't want to include? Why are the included ones included? Why are the excluded ones excluded?
What *goaded* you into choosing duped? Seeing as that even the answer says it has no connotation of compliance... It's just a synonym for tricked. Now I feel duped, but since I can use the DV arrow if I want, I'm 100% not in compliance. The definition of goaded might as well be, *I got you to do something that I wanted done* (with or w/o a stick).
Why do you think there is a “correct” answer?
Not that it is such, but why in the world would it matter if it were? Language needs redundancy.
Can you describe what should go in place of "_???_" in words, as I'm not really sure what concept you want to express. _An_ opposite of _compressive_ could be _expansive_; and in [longitudinal waves](https://www.siyavula.com/read/science/grade-10/longitudinal-waves/09-longitudinal-waves-02) you have _compression_ and _rarefaction_. But I'm not certain either apply to "tidal fields".
Sorta? Is that Spanish?
Why do you say moved? It is simply an interrogative, as opposed to a declarative or imperative or exclamatory sentence, or with those functions....And why do you call it an auxiliary verb? It is only verb. be there is copulative.
Is Keillor’s term in use *other than* describing bachelor farmers of Scandinavian descent living on the outskirts of the town of Lake Wobegone, where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking and all of the children are above average?
Is this a homework question?  Can you share your reasoning, and point to where you are stuck, and what's confusing you?
Just because an indirect complement can sometimes occur later in the clause (i.e. outside the NP) doesn't mean that NPs don't have internal dependents. In  [8] ii, the content clause is in construction with the head and together they form a constituent. The content clause is thus an internal dependent within the NP, like any other complement or modifier. What else could it be?  Where the indirect complement is outside the NP due to an intervening adjunct like "this year", the content clause is still labelled as a complement (an indirect one) since it is licensed by the head of the earlier NP.
Can you clarify why you are doubtful of the pre-KJV examples in the OED and why you think Shakespeare's usage is *undoubtedly* influenced by the KJV?
Why do you want to avoid the word 'set'? It's a pretty good word to describe what you are doing with the bounds, and is widely understood in software circles. It also has plenty of synonyms - prescribe, define, specify, assign, designate, ordain,...
@Shayan Please [edit] your post to include the context. Can you provide examples of the concepts you are attempting to contrast? A tribal society is almost by definition multi-tribal, but it's not clear whether you are talking about tribes in the sense of pre-modern organizing units of society or in the metaphorical sense where an occupation or political identity could represent a tribe.
How about *monoculture*?
You're the science writer and you're asking about what makes glaciers resist changes in velocity? There's an Earth sciences SE site just to let you know.
(1) and (2) are interrogatives. "Who" – unlike what” or “whoever” – cannot normally occur in the fused relative construction, except in the 'free choice' construction, which they are not -- note also that you can't say *"Who I am is none of your concern". The meaning of (1) for example can be glossed as "That's a big part of the answer to the question 'Who am I?'"
What I meant was that "Who I am is none of your concern" is not a possible fused relative construction. "Who I am" is an interrogative, where the meaning is "The answer to the question 'who am I?' is none of your concern".
@JK2 No, he differentiated *this use* of "Can I help who's next?". Suppose you're being blamed for someone being next in a show at the theatre, but you're only the stage manager, not the director; you might easily say "Look, can I help who's next?". In a non service context, that's the kind of meaning that might easily be given to the sentence. (Although, admittedly, so many people are in service situations so often, that many have probably heard that usage before without paying too much attention to it - so perhaps I shouldn't have said *always* there!)
Are you sure you're reading those google-found definitions right? They all seem to be slight variations on 'yield': "assent or agree to a demand, request, or treaty, synonyms: agree to, consent to, accept, assent to, acquiesce in, comply with, go along with, concur with, surrender to, yield to, give in to, give way to, defer to". The 2nd definition, "assume an office or position." could be read as 'acquiescing to a request to hold an office"
Sandy, I copied what I saw of 'the Google provided section at the top' in my comment. Is that what you saw also? But what I saw also agreed with the results lower from M-W and... Oh I just saw [the entry at Wiktionary ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accede) which gives the first entry as "(archaic, intransitive) To approach; to arrive, to come forward. ". 1) Wiktionary is not a trustworthy source: it has a lot of good stuff, but also a lot of bad and you never know what you're reading is which, unless you compare with other sources.
From a programming perspective, I?'m finding it difficult to see where you'd pass _one or the other_ in to the same parameter of the same call...you might have calls that expect net, others that expect gross (or calls that have a full breakdown or net, VAT (at several rates) carriage, discount, etc. and finally gross). If you really want to pass both into one call, an `enum` or similar might be better (`ValueType.Net` vs `ValueType.Gross` etc.). Either way, it's not really EL&U.
Are our references allowed to *be* dictionary definitions?
Wow. I wouldn’t have said that Bob’s comments were *excessively* family friendly. I work in software development, and even in that environment Dreta, Srid and Kiro comments would be in the minority. Maybe the word you are looking for is neurotypical?
It is unclear what you think "to toggle" means. Do you think it means "to turn on"? What does a dictionary say "to toggle" means? Last I knew it meant to change between two options. These may be "on" and "off", or they may be "red" and "blue"; in which case there is no opposite.
You may want to add this clarification to the text of the question, as well as perhaps to the title. Also, do you mean *information* or *solution*? They are not equivalent.

Thanks for the edit; this is a more interesting question. Does *testvériség* refer to a familial relationship (like "sibling-hood") or is it primarily a reference to camaraderie or cooperative spirit, or like English *brotherhood* (and its Latin-based counterpart *fraternity*) does it encompass both senses?
But wouldn't you agree that "Why not" when stated as an answer to a question, is simply a rhetorical question? And that's why it is shown in your cited dictionaries with the period instead of question mark punctuation?

Can you please link to a dictionary entry where *varied* carries the sense of *one-to-one mapping*? I haven't come across this use of *varied*. The natural sense of your first example is that the members could access a *heterogeneous* set of platforms (e.g. Apple, Windows, Linux, etc).
‘Varied’ doesn’t carry the one-to-one connotation you mentioned. Is that an important part of the word you seek? That is, are you looking for a word that carries the sense of a one-to-one mapping where each element of the range (the kinds of platforms, in your example) is unique?

Did you really mean to write **poicitian** in B's answer, or is it a typo? Either way, actually, B's answer sounds strange. If B mentioned some occupation clearly distinct from a used car salesman and a politician, then you could indeed conclude B thinks that people in all three occupations are untrustworthy. One exception is if the occupation that B mentions has something to do with A, in which case B's comment is probably ironic and it implies that it is A who shouldn't be trusted.

I don't understand what "promotion/demotion just like done in school" means.  Can you elaborate? I know that telling a student she has finished one grade and  is moving on to the next grade can be called "promoting" her. I've never heard of demotion in an academic setting.

Ok, if I called you and said simply "_I bought a car_", then you might ask "_When?_" In such a context you may feel that my statement is incomplete. But in most conversations the starting context and the past time in which something occurred is implicit and clear or an exact past time reference is unimportant. For example, in a conversation about a trip to New York last week, you might say "_I bought a new phone in Macy's_." It's implicit that the buying happened last week, but the day and time are irrelevant.

How loosely are you defining "the 'ñ' sound"? The way English speakers pronounce words like "piñata" is typically analyzed as containing a sequence of two sounds, an "n" sound and a "y" sound.

Well, it's true that "-igh" and "-ight" aren't exactly the same spellings, but don't you think John Lawler's answer there applies just as well to "high" as it does to "night"? In both cases, the explanation is "the word used to be pronounced with /x/ in Middle English, but this consonant sound was lost", so the modern English words  *high* and *night* are not in fact read as "hig-h" or "nig-h-t".

Even if you find the right word, such a statement would come off as abrupt and perhaps rude, maybe even hostile. Certainly it would be presumptuous.

I don't think questions on "why something was invented" are on topic in ELU because they are generally unanswerable or only allow subjective answers. If not, they are history. I suggest you change your format, e.g. "What Purpose does Title Case serve?" That allows an answer based on usage, even if the introduction (invention is a poor choice of words here) cannot be assigned to a particular individual.
It sounds like perhaps you are already thinking of a specific word in some another language, and are looking for an English equivalent?  If so, it would be helpful for reference (and interesting) to tell us the original word+language you have in mind.
Haven’t read all the comments, but isn’t this obvious?  When you read a sentence which word do you read first? And which word comes after that one?
But what is exactly your question? Do you want us to choose the right choice for each sentence?  And also offer alternatives? Notice that it may depend on your needs and the context (that you are not offering). I'm not flagging it but I think that your question is too broad. Maybe you should split it in various question, one per sentence, explaining the context and what are you exact doubts.

There's a big difference between fused relatives and subordinate interrogatives (embedded questions). Importantly, the latter are clauses functioning as complements, while the former are NPs. For example, "I've eaten [what you gave me]" is a fused relative construction, where the bracketed element is an NP. The meaning is comparable to that of the non-fused "I've eaten that which you gave me". By contrast, "I know where he is" is a subordinate interrogative, a clause meaning "I know the answer to the question 'Where is he?'"
@JK2 More revealing is the table on p3, where fused "why" is marked as ?*, where '*' means ungrammatical and ‘?’ signals that the matter is in doubt but there is a tendency in the relevant direction.

It is unclear what you are looking for. Are you trying to fill a slot in a sentence, and the syntax for that slot requires it to be a single word?

Not quite an answer to your question, but this is actually pretty common in the negative. If you google, you'll find a lot of examples of "not the best call" and "wasn't the best call" meaning that a decision wasn't good. Can you give us a little more context for your use?

For those  attempting a new answer, a more idiomatic way of writing the question is  "Why is the term 'unrequited'  so closely and exclusively associated with 'love'?"
Idiomatic' refers to a phrase and its naturalness for native speakers, in contradistinction to its following grammatical rules. That is, suppose you want to translate "Comment allez-vous?" to English. A literal translation is "How do you go?" which is perfectly grammatical English, but English speaking people never ever say that and say something else entirely. That is, the _phrase_ is not _idiomatic_ English.
Your title, "What is so idiomatic about 'unrequited'?' is _unidiomatic_ English, because you just don't use 'idiomatic' that way. You might ask "_Is_ 'unrequited love' (two words) idiomatic English?" (that is, do English speakers use it naturally, and of course the answer is yes. Also, asking 'Why?' is a very strange and unidiomatic question because there's no answering that, it just is, people just use that over and over, there's no 'why'.
Do you have evidence that it is used that way? I think of it as meaning "left very quickly"
You mean like the /ñ/ from Spanish, as in _piña colada?_ This sounds a little broad. I got a few, but I am gonna wait. The last Q I answered got downswiped for closeability.

It would be nice if you were more specific. Is it words new to Modern English (which will almost necessarily be loans directly from other languages? Is it single phonemes or clusters?

Would a more succinct way to say "an individual that is the only member of its kind" work for you? "Group of 1" is harder, since groups, by definition, usually consist of more than one member. If it really needs to be a term for a group, do you want a term that means "a group that can only fit one member" or instead "a group that only currently contains one member, but there's room for more"?
Okay, well I've retracted my closevote. I don't recognise your example usage though. Are you perhaps conflating ***pass*** with ***parse**?* I suggest you just switch to *...can you please **run through** it?* (or even more informal, ***eyeball** it*). And ask any future questions like this on [English Language Learners](http://ell.stackexchange.com/).

Can you give an example of a sentence where you would use the word? It’s not clear to me if you’re looking for a word thats ok to say to their face or not.
I read it with emphasis in *were*.  The context I envision is that a group of people are running through their money at a terrific rate but because they believe they won't survive, it really doesn't matter.   When someone asks, "What if we do survive?"  This is the answer.  In other words, if we do end up surviving this, we won't be able to continue to spend at our current rate, we'll have to drastically reduce our expenditures.
As one of the answers below indicates that the people you're trying to describe are intentionally using words incorrectly, can you please verify if this is correct or not? My understanding was that they are rather 'speaking faster than they can think', and thus end up using the wrong words, but they don't worry about it as they (generally) get the words close enough that you (as listener) can figure out what they mean. I too know people who would fit this description and am also interested in finding a good word/concise phrase to describe it.
Why would you want to replace *at*? Why do you need *with*? Is there a reason?
I don't understand what distinction you are trying to make. How can it be a statistical property if it isn't measured?
You mean like the pen is mightier than the word?
in your native tongue such a (non offensive) word does exist? Also, your sample sentence only makes sense to me if the invited person is absolutely expected to bring a treat to the occasion - in my mind, that is only true for house-warmings, birthdays, weddings, and the like, not for any invitation. Could you expand on that aspect?
I'm still unclear on the concept: I guess from your comment, that in your question "[...]who ONLY ASK for a treat but never really take one[...]" should actually read"[...]who ONLY ASK for a treat but never really give one[...]" ?, However your sample sentence then is: "Just invite him. He'll not join us anyway, he is a person-that-does-not-invite-but-likes-being-invited"  -- and i do not understand why a person that likes being invited would not come to such an event? EDIT: I think i got it now: This person likes being asked to join a dinner, but never attends the dinner, right?
What is the context that your reader can possibly think you might mean all the cores in the universe? Give me a lever and a place to stand and I will rewrite the sentence in two words. Heck, don't even give me the context. The word *available* all by itself already clearly says that it's specifically *not* all the cores in the universe. You don't have a point.
_buon nova_ isn't Latin [fixed], but why do you think that this would have a specific answer in this way? Mr Howell is very openly drawing his use from Italian, whereas there's no claim that he's actually the earliest citation and others would've been drawing from Latin (where, for what it's worth, the saying makes more sense: the grammar permits skipping the copula and using the exact same word to capture the different senses of _no new_ [_things_] [_is_] _good new_ [_s_]).

Just checking: do the activities involve someone connected to the case, or are you simply making preparations of your own in anticipation of the outcome? E.g. if BigCo sues AnotherBigCo for violating BigCo's monopoly on web browsers (for argument's sake), are you doing something with BC/ABC, or are you independent of both and instead (say) gearing up your own web browser to hit the market in anticipation that the monopoly gets struck down in the course of the proceedings?

What was the date of the first quote for the OED entry 29c? I would think that would answer your first two questions. 'corrupt', though it fits for the same situation, means and insinuates very different things. 'corrupt' is from the point of view of where it was turned _from_, the idea of a traitor to the first cause.
The full OED's entry for ***turn*** is nearly as long as the one for ***set*** (stereotypically, the word with the longest definition in English dictionaries). But to be honest I think the distinction between switching allegiance to a particular religious faith or to a particular country's security services is so trivial it's barely worth explicitly providing a separate (sub-)definition. I'd say it might well have been used in the "spy" sense way back in Shakespeare's time - the fact that we don't have unambiguous written evidence of that *(**yet**?!)*  may be just an accident of history.

Is the "not speaking their native language" part important? Many "period drams" will have (native) English-speaking characters use an "old fashioned" form of English: sometimes accurately reflecting the speech-patterns of the time, but sometimes just because using "modern day slang" would sound odd.

As to "How informal?", I'd say it's not really a "formal" usage (more "stylised, poetic"), but it's certainly not a construction people would normally use in relaxed conversation.

It seems the real issue is social/cultural/psychological, not linguistic: how do you convince people that a source they regard as authoritative can be wrong on a specific point?  One possibility is to ask your colleagues: if a Chinese source and an Anglophone source disagreed on a question of Chinese pronunciation, which would they trust more, and why?  Then — in part by analogy, and in part because you’re reassuring them that you’re not dismissing Chinese sources in general — they may be more willing to accept that an Anglophone source is more reliable for English pronunciation.

Don't worry about ***every*** pair of consecutive words; for example, "guy I" (in your first sentence) is not a common phrase, but the sentence as a whole works.  (Well, actually, it's a bit awkward, but never mind that.)  Do you understand what it means to use "by" together with a time?
I think this question would be easier to understand if you gave an example of a sentence using this construction. Are you talking about stuff like "a room in which to read books" or "a box in which to store the papers"?
Do you mean their KIT is raised and diphthongized, or just raised?
Are you sure you heard your teacher correctly? Although this claim is not true for English pronoun "I", this _does_ happen **in the opposite direction**. This is called the "[royal we](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we)" where a monarch refers to himself or herself in the plural.
Are you writing this story? Or is it one you're reading? Also, which variety of English is this? Which region do the speakers come from and what is their socioeconomic status?
Are other question words considered some kind of conjunctions? I'd trust a common thread among published dictionaries over Wikipedia.
@Zebrafish Nothing can be more illogical than that. Certain words (in certain contexts) could, and ought to be defined in certain roles. Else you can't make sense of anything said or written at all. That doesn't mean every word should unconditionally have a POS cast in stone for it.  Read a word as a noun in a sentence and it makes sense, read the same sentence with the word as a verb and it no longer makes sense, or worse, it works in an entirely different way and means something else altogether. Right?
Is the issue  with *were/was* or is it with *have*? Clarify. See also [ell.se] Good Luck.

Is it possible that the exam compiler has translated an Italian phrase equivalent to "neither here nor there" but done it literally? That could produce this sort of oddity.
1) _leaving to New York_ is non-idiomatic; you _leave for_. If you say, _I am leaving for New York tomorrow_, the act of leaving is the slightly more important information. "Can you come to dinner?" Most people would answer, "No, I'm leaving for New York tomorrow.” The act of leaving (and so can't come to dinner) is the important information. "I leave for New York tomorrow" would more likely answer the question "When are you leaving." or "Where are going?"
Just to clarify - you are looking for an expression to indicate someone whose stage of completion in terms of exams and coursework is less than the expected number for the time he has spent on the Degree course?

_Ambush journalist_ does seem to be in use. A quick googling finds me examples [here](https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/05/media/jesse-watters-chinese/), [here](https://www.youtube.com  v=vB5vL4bJeug), [here](https://www.conservapedia.com/Chris_Wallace) and [here](https://www.thewrap.com/hillary-clinton-christopher-stevens-video-jason-mattera/). It also follows naturally from _ambush journalism_, of course. What makes you think _ambush journalist_ can't be used?
Approaching this from another angle (although maybe not a helpful one) - an ambush interview could be one of many techniques used by a reporter into order to get the story, but does not necessarily mean they should be characterized as an "Ambush Journalist".   Are they an aggressive investigative reporter?  Perhaps this can make the term less generic.   That said - +1 for @tmgr for doorstep/doorstepping/doorstepper, though the definition doesn't necessarily imply aggression.

Why would anyone doubt the impeccable grammar of someone like C.S. Lewis?
For a translation, it is best to give a longer description what you think is the meaning of the original word in the target language. Is 'Mittagsmenü' a menu (listing of options) at lunchtime? Or is it like in France, a prix fixe meal at lunchtime? A potential answer is 'lunch menu' (it is what you call the special list of usually cheaper meal options a restaurant has at lunchtime).
I drank coffee or "I had coffee"? We abuse `had` all the time, so its usage in your sentence looks fine to me. The overall sentence appears unnecessarily complicated though.

Hi, welcome to ELU! Are you wondering specifically about schools in England in Charlotte Brontë's time (*Jane Eyre* was published in the mid-1800s), or were you also asking about schools in other English-speaking locales and/or in the current era?
If initialism means what I think it does, then you can't. The best you can do is an abbreviation like W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), K9, G20, MI5. Your R6S would be an abbreviation, I don't think it would meet the requirements for either acronym or initialism. Abbreviation though, yes. Interestingly most of these abbreviations are listed under the Wikipedia acronym article, though I don't think it contends they are acronyms. Is it an unimportant point whether your abbreviation is an initialism or acronym or any other 'thing'?
What real-world con­text and reg­is­ter do you hope to use this for? This mat­ters a great deal: for­mal­ity, coarse­ness, in-group iden­ti­fi­ca­tion, etc. That blank in *“You are just ________.”* lends it­self equally well to ad­jec­tives and nouns alike, even to mul­ti­word phrases. Your ex­am­ple sug­gests you’re look­ing for some­thing to use in ca­sual con­ver­sa­tion, **ɴᴏᴛ** some­thing to be used in writ­ing—is that so? Would you be ok with “new” and trendy busi­ness-speak jar­gon or even an in­for­mal slang ex­pres­sion, and thus some­thing not ev­ery­one would rec­og­nize?
Since there's no 'was leaving' option, which do you think is the most suitable out of the options?

*wanna*? Seriously? Please don't write that. It makes you look bad.
That's correct: it's how we pronounce what we write as *want to*. It’s what’s called [*eye dialect*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_dialect), and it makes you look either uneducated or else pretending to be so, like some yokel in a fiction novel that the author is trying to make sound like... well, a yokel. *Aikin ride in I’d aleck thachool jis nev argit* and then where we will all be? I strongly advise that when you're ***writing*** English, you use **only** standard ***written*** English to do so — and *forra longa time den ya think ya hafta, k?*  It’s only appropriate in some places.
*O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?* is surely much better known than *What's in a name?*
Hi Raghav, welcome to EL&U. Regrettably, I'm flagging this question for closure: proofreading questions ("Is this correct?", "Is there a better way to write this passage?") are off-topic unless a specific source of concern in the text is clearly identified. For further guidance, see [ask] and take the EL&U **[Tour]**. :-)
Are the two solutions of the same quality or not?
Some people' is a NP following 'what'. Could you clarify what you are asking?
It does matter. "What some people do for a crust" is an exclamation, but not an exclamative clause. This is the pronoun "what", not exclamative "what", which is an adjective. See what I mean?
Take a look at p435 [5], where it talks of **the adjectives "such" and exclamative "what"**. How much clearer can it be? In your example, "what some people" is not a constituent. The pronoun "what" is object of "do", i.e. it figures in clause structure.
Why contrast? They are closer to expressing reason.
Hi Jim, how did a reputable online dictionary define each of the words? What differences did you notice? Wikipedia is full of interesting information but it's not a dictionary. Please [edit] your post to include the research you've done on the *definitions* of the words, and let us know if there's still an issue we need to resolve. :-)
Who the heck still has ***masters*** and ***servants***??? Is this for fiction  of an imagined or bygone era?
I'm not convinced this is meaningful question: OP already knows the etymology and that some Germanic languages form/formed _godmother_ etc. in like manner but just isn't satisfied with it. Really, what more is to be said? One might as well as why Latin, Spanish, French etc. do _not_ use a _god_-equivalent prefix.... and that sounds just as silly, as it presupposes English/Germanic languages as normative. As a side note, [_gossip_](https://www.etymonline.com/word/gossip#etymonline_v_9074) has a fascinating - and related - origin.
Can you cut and paste the sentence and some context from that link? The link is great but you want the text here too.
What is the confusion? In the word *paywall* there are two syllables but each syllable also exists as a word on its own. Neither of the two syllables in *prickle* exist as independent words, so these are *non-word* syllables.
A fill-in-the-blank context can't *just* be a blank. "allowed to be missing” is just a blank. Where's the rest of the sentence?
Is this question about intransitive prepositions, intransitive verbs, or intransitivity? How does CGEL define intransitivity? (presumably valency zero)

Why are you calling a device a multi-context device if it is associated with only 1 context?
So, if I understand correctly: you manufactured them, and then someone else customized them, and then they got stored somewhere (by an unspecified entity)?  If the customizing was not part of the manufacturing, then applying an adverb that means "customized" to "manufactured" as in your example sentence is inappropriate.
Is it a custom order or are these custom items, or both? Do you mean that it was a custom order of some sort, or that it was a regular order of custom-made items? Why do you need an adverb? Why aren’t these just custom items that you made for someone and safely stored?
How about _deteriorated_?
Have you done any research, with dictionaries etc? This is the type of thing we discuss on the site, but we do like questioners to have done a little basic research of their own first.

Are you using "it" to refer to the couch, or to the jump?
Are you asking (1) whether such use in fact occurs, or (2) whether it should be regarded as a mistake or as a sign that there has been a 'change in definition'? Given that you say that you, yourself have noticed that the phrase is used that way, and provide an example of it, the answer to (1) seems to be clearly 'yes'. One's answer to (2) will likely depend on where one stands on the prescriptivism-descriptivism spectrum.
Modern grammars don't use the term 'gerund'. In "Do you mind [my/me telling the truth]?", the bracketed element is a non-finite clause headed by the verb "telling". That it's a verb is evident from the fact that it can be modified by an adverb, but not an adjective: "Do you mind [my/me occasionally / *occasional telling the truth]?" The genitive alternant is generally preferred in formal style.
I see nothing wrong with your passive. I only don't like the unbalanced predicate of the relative clause, where you have "kind" and "compassionate" separated by a comma and linked with "was" and then an action verb. I prefer: *I will be remembered as an individual who was kind, compassionate and helpful.* OR *I will be remembered as an individual who behaved kindly, showed compassion and helped others.* Can you see how the unbalance has been fixed?
Why don't you want to use "female students"? Are you wanting to indicate adult female students specifically?

A few initial thoughts: American English is also based on British English and has rhotic dialects. Indian English also has a multigenerational history, functioning as a lingua franca from the 19th century through Indian Independence and to today. Even Scotland has rhotic dialects. Why wouldn't some Indian English dialects be rhotic?

This question doesn't make sense. Are you asking whether you can say *I think walking* instead of *I think while walking*? If that's what you mean, (a) please [edit] your question to make that clear, and (b) the answer is only if the first verb *can't* take the second as an object. *I can think walking* is ambiguous since walking might be the object of think, whereas *I can walk chewing gum* is unambiguous. The grammar experts may be able to explain why in better terms than this :-)
Specific to what? paying or inventing? The adverb progressively could work.
How about *on an **as needed** basis*?
I have never heard of “invent along the way”  is it more along the lines of flying by the seat of your pants? Or jury rigging? Or crossing that bridge when you get to it?
Was "British Empire" ever the official title of the British empire?
Are you truly asking for an idiom? I can think of several words that work, but are not idioms.
You're asking a number of interesting but opinion-based questions. Your sample sentence doesn't work well with either of the two words (why would something good anticipate something disturbing?). Adumbrate means a number of things, but where it overlaps with foreshadow, the former is weaker (only a hint). And really, assessing a neologism is difficult (and usually makes for a poor question here).
Is there some connection between the top part of your question and the bottom part?
To be honest, I don't think it is an exact duplicate, but it's *very* closely related and the provided answers may explain why.  Also, generally speaking our membership expects a cursory research effort before handling questions. If I am mistaken, would you explain why the other question is insufficient? It'd help fulfill those expectations.
So I see my answer in favor of yes on the basis of the body of the question and I see that the answer in favor of no is rooted in the title of the question, but after looking carefully I think the question is actually forked in two -- that is, which are you actually asking? If the word "mislead" implies intent, or if the choice of words "I feel misled" implies a perspective that the speaker feels that the misleading was intentional? Because those answers are "no" and "yes," respectively.

No one preposition always goes with *rant*. What is your intended meaning, or what dictionary have you used to try to answer this?
@Happy In that case what sort of differentiation are you wanting to make? Even if someone says "Take a squint at this" the noun is obviously related to an action rather than to a condition whereas "He was born with a squint but it was corrected surgically" obviously relates to the condition. It's very similar to the difference between the noun and verb "bear" where the context tells you which was intended. It's clearer than "He held a ball" where it's unclear whether he was gripping a sphere or organising a dance.
Do you mean that there are two interferometers, one in the exitation beam path and one in the emission beam path? If so part of your problem is that you have not made that indisputably clear at the outset.

This question is formulated as a question about the correct use of the prepositions, but it seems me that it is really about the implications of the word *removal*. In most of its uses, it implies that the move is from some more desirable, more central place, to an inferior, peripheral one (it is somewhat akin to 'banish'). In furniture-related contexts, in British English, it, however, does not have that implication. The question is: can it be used without that implication for something other than furniture?
If it's a "machine" why are you searching for terms relating to organisms? That doesn't seem "intensely accurate" to me, as similes and metaphors go.

What’s the difference?  At that time there was one landmass. We’ve called that landmass Pangaea. The continents as we know them didn’t come together to form a union. Pangaea split apart and we named the pieces.

Why are you telling me about it having been discredited?? I am citing a text where the phrase you asked about is used.
Glad that it helps but I'm afraid I can't post that as an answer to the question as it stands now (`What do you call a person that holds sensitive information?`). If you feel _quarry_ is the right answer, then you have to modify the question to remove reference to _holding confidential information_ and emphasize on the fact that they are after him irrespective of the reason.

Why android? A webapp (if it exists) is just as good.
Could you please edit your question to explain more clearly what you are asking for?  Any answer would depend on how the two clauses disjoined by ‘or’ are related.  Are they two different ways of expressing the same feature, or are they two different features altogether?  In other words, does the “cumbersome system” consist of dealing with a “convoluted pile of spreadsheets”, or is it something else besides this?
How do you know you're "thinking the right word"? Do you try to formulate your sentences or clauses in their entirety before speaking them?  Is it as if you're reading from a closed caption in your head?
How else do you mean it could be pronounced? Why would anyone "raise an eyebrow" when it's just natural and logical? Can you please expand?
You're talking about setting a value in the template, like a constant, and then referring to that value  elsewhere by a name assigned to it, something like "@presenter-name", so that if the presenter needs to be changed, you only have to change the name in one place.  You want a noun that means the taking of such an approach in document assembly contexts?
Is a single word necessary? 'henpecked husband' has two after all.
You tagged this single-word-requests but didn't necessarily say that. Some good answers will have multiple words. Also, are you looking for contemporary words we'd use today (in common parlance), or archaic/ literary words like 'shrew' or 'harridan', which pretty much only ever occur in writing (or recherche speech)? And why must it be a noun phrase like 'she is a nag' or 'she is a henpcker'; that's less common than 'she nags her husband' or 'she henpecks her husband'.
**single word or multiple word? noun-phrase or adjective or verb?**
When you say 'some products' I assume that there are a number of loosely related or unrelated products in the range, perhaps a word processor, a graphics package, a movie editor and so on. I find it difficult to believe that you can train people to _use_ a number of different products in one day, what I suspect you are doing is _introducing_ them to the products and explaining the advantages of Atlassian products over your competitors' products. Is this the case?
I'm not even sure what you're asking.  It doesn't seem simple, like "Do they use different sets of skills?" but rather something like, "Will you read better and write better if the one activity requires a different set of skills than the other does?"  So, please draw on whatever set of skills is needed to ask a clear question.  ;)
Do you really mean "far away", such as on different continents?

Where does this quote come from? It looks like an editing error.
I notice that you write your name in Russian.  The absence of an article before 'full time' suggest to me that as speaker of Russian, a language which does not use articles, may I ask you to check that the original quotation isn't "In the time of THE full-blown crisis in the country's history"?  Is so, then there might be a case for inserting the 'most'.
I was editing my comment as you wrote.  How does it look now?
Do you mean "I was like" in the informal use where "to be like" is followed by response or thought or feeling in quote form, as is: "He told me he was working late, and I was like 'You'd better not be lying to me'"? Or do you mean it in the more literal sense. Usually [someone said something] "and I was like 'XYZ'", usually it means the person responded with 'XYZ', or thought it, or felt it, or many other possible things. It's not a literal use. "He said I could have them for $20, and I'm like 'No way!'".
For me the opposite of seeing only two extremes is seeing nuance. "2. Expression or appreciation of subtle shades of meaning, feeling, or tone:" Balanced thinking would work too as well as nuanced. Interestingly, gradate is a word too, so gradated? You can check a thesaurus.
Splitting is the jargon of a particular profession. Are you looking for yet more jargon, or for a word or phrase that a lay person would use?

How are these two sentences presented or commented on by the writer of the grammar text? Are they part of a quiz question and if so, what does the answer key say?
The function of a phrase typically depends on the part of speech of the phrase's head, so I don't see why you it's obviously a "gross mistake" to suppose that the word "eating" in "The man [eating this cake]" might be grammatically distinct in some way from the word "eating" in "[Eating this cake] is easy." I haven't read the relevant parts of CGEL in a while, but doesn't it address some arguments for a distinction in the course of ultimately arguing against that distinction?
The (supposed) difference may only be apparent at (or above) the phrase level, but  the diagnostic tests for distinguishing (gerund-)participles from adjectives are mostly at the phrase level, aren't they? "Takes a direct object" or "is modified by *very*" are phrase-level tests for word-level categorizations.
You ask: _Why does traditional grammar still use the 'gerund'/'present participle' dichotomy for the very same form 'V-ing'_? Do you mean: _Why do some modern-day grammarians still make this distinction?_ In which case, can you name (and ideally cite from) one or two who do.
Can you give more context? Where did you see this? Give the whole paragraph. As it stands, this is not a set phrase or idiom in English or even a proverb.
Assume the writer is using the unknown vocabulary correctly, "failure to convey an intended idea to a given audience because the speaker is using vocabulary that the audience happens not to know" sounds like a description of *jargon*. That word has obviously crossed your mind, so you must have decided it doesn't fit.  Why not?

"Shih Tzu" is the Wade-Giles romanization of the Chinese characters 獅子, meaning lion; this romanization scheme was in use when the breed was first introduced in America.* Is that not good enough for you? Anyway, the question seems to be more about *Chinese* than "Use of English".

When you ask which is more popular, you're asking which is more likely to be used?
There are *many* differences. You'll find 'satisfied' in the context of maths equations, for example, and I'm pretty sure linguists have a (relatively) formal context where they use 'happy'. But the question as posed here is too open-ended to really be answered within the SO format. Is there any *specific* context you're concerned about? And what *have* you found out from your own research, that's insufficient for your needs?
When do you mean? While school is in session or at graduation?
*That is very weird*.   Are you saying that **very** is a complement of **weird** because **weird** is a matter of degree and thus licenses **very**?   Aren't complements *required* not merely *licensed*?
Why is *of spiders* considered a complement there and not simply an adjunct presenting the source of Ed's fearful state? In  *Ed is afraid for his life*  is *for his life* also a complement?
It's "This sentence does prohibit ... .", so it is "Does this sentence prohibit ... ?". "This sentence prohibits ... ." is , however, also correct.
Are you asking about _kidsfriendly_ or _kid-friendly_? _Kid_ is more informal than _child_, which may or may not be appropriate for your project. Another question: you have _Lern_ in KARLI. Should it be _Learn_ (or better: _Learning_?
Sorry, I forgot the OP.  I hope someone can explain the *dual analysis* because I don't see it. (Are you agreeing with Postal?)
I would take issue with your claim that "chronic" informally means "severe".  Can you cite some attestations?
Why does everybody think that anything you do should be describable in one word?
You really want to use the phrase "digital footprint"? Is that part of the "challenge" here?
Is the arena to be a space (either physical or virtual) where gamers compete against each other, or is it to be a space where games can be played by a number of gamers but not, necessarily, involving the other gamers using the same space? Any answer I give might be influenced by your response to this comment.

Did you come up with "carried himself with gravitas"? I would say: He displayed or had gravitas. Carrying oneself is slightly dated, isn't it? Maybe ok in writing...
This is so broad as to be difficult to answer. Why not folks, friends, esteemed guests, patrons, y'all, distinguished guests, everybody, Proudfeet, and the tens of other variations?
What do you mean when you write *Asking this in search of "to make do"*?  Do you mean that you're asking this to see if it's related to "to make do"?  If so, then no -- as explained in the answers, it comes from *how you **do** your hair*.  Analogy: *In Detroit they make cars; this year they've come out with a new make of car.*
Are you ruling out the _no article_ option?
Do you want a choice between just those two options or different alternatives?
I'm not the OP, but I grabbed the nearest dictionary (Webster's New Collegiate 9th) and couldn't find anything about when a misspelling becomes correct or when the original correct spelling becomes incorrect. Is it somewhere in the pages of text in the front, about the history of the English language and dictionaries? I'm not gonna try and find it there with my weak eyes. More guidance, please. Thanks, @Jim
Can you give us a link to the manga or the name of the book?
Notice that earth and throw are different tongue movements. Is one more difficult for you? When I say earth, I start with the "r" sound and I end up with my tongue slightly between my teeth. But when I say throw, my tongue starts between my teeth and ends in the middle of the mouth as I make the "r" sound
Was the person who said this a native speaker? If yes, then the answer is yes.
Probably *most* people who are obsessed with hypothetical "What If" scenarios are primarily focused on possible ***futures*** (where we don't *know* what will actually happen). But (at least in principle) for ***past*** situations we *do* know what did or didn't happen. So are you talking about people who think a lot about what might have happened (but in fact *didn't*), or what perhaps *really* happened (but maybe we can't be sure). And do these people think those possible past situations were / would have been ***good**?* Or are they glad they *didn't* happen ('cos they'd be ***bad***?).
A common meme that uses the _ing-form_ after what Swan calls superlatives is: _Will the last person leaving Seattle turn out the lights_.   Other Google examples include: _The first student sitting in their seat will get a treat_ and _The last person standing up with no chair to sit down in, gets the ball._ It seems that the _ing-form_ can be used for actions that are or will be in progress and is problematic in contexts where the action has completed: _?The last person standing up got the ball._ If I have time I will pursue this line of thought.
What is the name of the section in the Swan book you quote from? In my copy of Swan (Third edition) neither section 495 nor page 495 has the sentences you include.
Do you mean units as in meters, units as in "condo units", or units as in sectioned off pieces of a larger whole?
Button 2 seems at least ambiguous, since "alert" and "mute" can be both nouns and verbs. Does the button mute an alert, or alert a mute setting?
I wonder if it could be a misspelling of *pining* (like longing for something). He wants something; pining, eh?
does E see A and then does the huggie, or does A remain unseen by E? In other words is A 'caught'?
Are the 'definitions' that you've quoted, your own definitions or from a dictionary?  If the latter, please specify - and preferably provide links to - the respective dictionaries.  I'm suggesting this because someone has already voted to close your question for lack of research.
Could you give an example of the rhetorical device?

I remember my French teacher told us that when you start dreaming in the second language you are actually beginning to master it. One day a fellow student came into the class and told the teacher he had had a dream the past night in French finally. The teacher said "wonderful!...and what was the dream about?" Then he got a really sad look and said, "I didn't understand a word of what anybody in the dream was saying..."
Part of your problem may be that you are trying to translate mentally. That can slow you down. Better to have an internal dialogue in which you are constantly asking yourself in English "What am I doing now, or what am I going to do, or what are they doing?" and then answer yourself. It worked for me. (except in Spanish)
What's wrong with "Please consider fixing this."?
It's unclear to me what you mean by *redaction error*. How are you using the term *redaction*?
Wow, just noticed that my phone helpfully corrected “But if you” to “Burundi you” ??!
Does it matter whether you call it an adjective or a verb? In those sentences you list, both are participles being used as attributive modifiers.
I am with @sky on this. Is it not enough to say that both _broken_ and _murdered_ are past participle forms that can be used attributively, i.e. they  fulfil one of the tests that categorises words as adjectives? _Attributively_ in this context means premodifying the noun. For example, _afraid_ is an adjective that can __not__ be used attributively, and _mere_ is an adjective that can __only__ be used attributively.
My point is that both _broken_ and _murdered_ pass one of the essential syntactic tests of adjectives, namely they can premodify nouns. _Broken_ also passes a morphological test of adjectives; it can take the prefix _-un_, which _murdered_ cannot. But neither pass the _can be made into an adverb test_: e.g. _happy > happily_, _broken > *brokenly_. As a teacher I am most interested in usage not classification. So the question _Is 'murdered' an adjective or a verb in the phrase 'a murdered man'?_ is not one that adds any value for me or my students. But I am willing to be persuaded otherwise!
@listeneva As Shoe suggests, the real question is Why do you want to classify it? What does the classification clarify?
I looked it up on google but found nothing isn't particularly helpful. What were your *exact* search parameters, and what were your results? I'll edit in what I found, but feel free to correct it.
What do you mean by topic and where is this topic, anyway?? Who is expounding it?
Your first sentence says "I'm looking for a word to describe the outline of a paper document." If that is an accurate description of the situation then you've already used the word that is right for you. If not, what is wrong with 'outline'?
What is your mother tongue, Marco, is it an East Asian language? I know that Mandarin has units, usually called 'measure words' for everything including the universal 'ge' for all nouns which have no known specific measure word. This is one of the things which English speakers (like me) find awkward when learning Mandarin because English has very few equivalents. There are unit names for uncountable nouns like "water", "sand" and "timber" but the only one I can think of for a countable noun is "head of cattle".
Is it bothering you that *on what grounds* appears to be acting as the subject of *did not appear*?  Would you prefer that it were *the grounds for which did not appear* or *whose grounds did not appear*?
What do you mean by 'aint'? Are you referring to the informal "I ain't" for "I am not"?
Perhaps: *You yourself haven't had similar thoughts as well?*  "Yourself" can give a similar flavor to "even."  You can make a skeptical question by taking a sentence and putting a question mark at the end.  You would pronounce it with a skeptical or persuasive tone.  Or perhaps: *Haven't you yourself had similar thoughts as well?*
Is this about political correctness? A PC person sees people in terms of race or ethnicity all the time without being hateful about it, but it's not exclusively about that?
The first NP "What you see" ("the thing that you see") is the subject, and the second NP "what you get" ("the thing that you get") is the subject complement. Are you familiar with fused relative constructions?
It doesn't have a subject-predicate structure. In "the thing that you see", "thing" is head of the NP, and "that you see" is a relative clause modifying "thing". The whole expression can't be a clause because it has no main verb. Okay now?
Since when are expressions involving cultural or geographic references based on factual information? Plenty of them are contradictory, anyway. Half of Europe call a *roller coaster* a *Russian mountain* (*montagnes russes*, *montaña rusa*, etc.), yet the Russians call them *American mountains* (Американские горки). What is the *Irish goodbye* to Americans is called the *French leave* by the British, and somehow that is simultaneously cognate to *filer à l'anglaise* and *sich auf polnisch empfehlen*.
No, that’s clear I think. My point is:  Heat Level: (Hot, Cold, Freezing)  Effectiveness: (Extreme, moderate, somewhat, none)  Volume: (Loud, moderate, soft, faint)  what is measured? For heat level: Temperature.  For Effectiveness: Time to respond. For Volume: sound pressure level. Etc.  Therefore: Heat level is assigned based on temperature.  Effectiveness is assigned based on time to respond. Volume is assigned based on sound pressure level.  Action priority is assigned based on time before deadline.  Some things are trivial: Height (Tall, Medium, Short) is assigned based on ... Height.
What does the dictionary suggest? For instance, what is the difference between "not concealed" and "made known"? When I unconceal something, do I necessarily have to reveal it?
Your "different question" link seems broken. Why did the other answers not suffice? Could you post some of them here?
How do you know that the em dash is more common in the US? I know commentators tend to sing its praises compared to the en-dash, but I feel like I've seen the latter more in student writing, and I don't have the first clue for how to figure out common typographies.
Is your concern really with 'were' or is it with 'crooked' which you consider insufficiently extreme?
Would [pejorative-language] or [insults] be included in this?
You're right, that sentence sounds awfully awkward, especially the 'while ago' part. Why doesn't "Why did you do that?" capture everything?
What did a thesaurus say? "meet" is probably what you want, it's the most neutral of all. Since you used the word 'stakeholders', you may be open to the managementese 'liaise'.
How can the grand total be 205+ **million**, when the first item listed in the column is 26.5 **billion**, & the second item in the column is 6.01 **billion**?
Are you asking if grammatical context can change the meaning? Like is it clear from grammar which meaning of "exact" is meant by "He wrote the exact number" versus "He is going to exact revenge"?
If a word can have two meanings dependent on context or grammar, then those words are homonyms by definition aren't they? By excluding homonyms aren't you just asking about how a word can have two meanings, but excluding cases when a word has two meanings?
Where are these sentences being used? If it's in a scientific paper then the use of chemical symbols would probably be acceptable. In more general publications, I would always spell out the chemical name.
What is the point of manipulating at length an old text? The legal point is that the contract terms govern whether or not the reason for rejection of the product is something else.
How about 'the celestial sphere'? Works from on Earth and also off the Earth.
Can you give a bit of context?  Where did you read this, and what was the topic under discussion where this sentence appeared?  Grammatically, the sentence is broken ("to be in experiments" doesn't naturally connect with either "to allocate" or "all requests"), but without a clue as to intended meaning, it's hard to point out where the error is.

Can you, with your words, describe the situation that is opposite to "the bottle is on the table" or ""the picture is on the wall?" I mean, it is on, or it is not on. How could it be opposite?
Oh, so you are asking about the name of the support? Because in your question you said "antonym," which means "opposite of." Opposite of on can be only off, but I now understand your question. I think you should edit that part.
What research have you done with online dictionaries? The Cambridge suggests an answer to your question in terms of slang or formality. It also appears that there is a British/US usage difference that I was unaware of. In any case it appears that your question should be posted on English Language Learners.
The comma seems to be separating "city, state" as in "New York, NY" or "Houston, TX", so the adjacent is meant as a noun, which wiktionary would have told you. Although, it's liable to be understood as adverb or adjective in spoken speech, similar to "I know fuck all". What's the difference to you? It's an explitive to be parsed however one feels like, pretty close to explitives. What's the syntax of "Shit!"? Your mother ...

There's the KJV:  "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
Is the referent of "you" by any chance plural? In that case, "don't" would be correct: *It's not just you (guys) that don't know.*
The question "In English, why does ...?" is frequently unanswerable, other than to say, "Because." As an aside, [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shop) includes two examples of another non-count usage: *I am taking shop this semester. / I made a table in shop.* NB "very unique" is allowable, but grading an absolute will invite argument. :-)
*to go aship, to board ship*, analoguously *to set up a shop* > *to set up shop*?
Does the [OED’s entry on *butcher’s broom*](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/25336) help at all? An 1847 citation reads: *The whole plant is gathered by butchers, and made into besoms for sweeping their blocks and shops; and hence it obtained the name of **butcher's broom.*** The oldest citation for the English term is from a 1538 treatise in Latin: *Humile officinæ uocant bruscum, angli **Butchers broome**, & Petygrew.*
Could you please mark the time in the segment?
Even if "date of earliest attested usage" isn't given by any answers to that earlier question, I suggest that's where this detail ***should*** be. It's ridiculous to have separate questions+answers for ***Why**?* and ***When**?* in respect of the same usage.
Could you rewrite the example sentence with a `_____` placeholder where you want the word or phrase to go?
*Manageable* is fine. *Workable. Cooperative. Flexible. Compliable.* A million others. Also, why do you need it to be an adjective. Also also, what do you mean "it's definitely not a word"? It definitely looks like a word to me. What else is it?
I'm not sure what *work-with-able* is supposed to mean if it doesn't mean *manageable*.  If it does mean *manageable*, why would you need another word?
As to words being or not being recognized by dictionaries, that's a dangerous approach to take. All dictionaries always lag behind the actual language, by definition. In order to find its way into a dictionary, the word needs to be created first. Note that "Reg" is not recognized by any dictionary, and neither is "Amir". Are these not words? Why are we calling ourselves things that are not words? How are people supposed to refer to you or me if our names are not words?

Possibly this is more extreme than what you are looking for, but: "I'd rather reign in Hell than serve in Heaven."?
I introduced B in place of A.  Look we really need to know the context -- cooking?  Chemistry?  Also, do you need to leave it vague, where the reader doesn't know if you added extra B, or only substituted B in place of A?
What don't you like about your text?
What happens next? implies that the person being asked can reasonably be thought to know. For example if you are on a theme park ride with someone who has ridden it before you could ask "What happens next?" when the car pauses and they might reply "We go down a vertical drop". However it's also possible to say "What will happen next?" When no one can know and receive only the answer "Only time will tell". "What happens next" is sometimes used in place of "What will happen next" but, strictly speaking, the two sentences have different meanings.
Welcome to EL&U. As Lawrence notes, *superior* and *senior* each have multiple different uses, some of which may be more acceptable with *very* than others. What idea are you trying to express?
Is this a real dialogue you're quoting - or at least, is the structure taken from a real spoken sentence?  It doesn't make sense exactly as written. Of course, people very frequently speak in ways that don't make perfect sense.  In this case, it would probably be because of an elision. A more complete and grammatical version would be: "When you say you 'liked cats,' what do you mean?  Could you tell me more?"
What's more important to you -- to learn practical, common ways of using *whether*, or to get a yes/no on each of your proposed sentences?
Elisha, did you look up the word in some dictionaries? We expect people to do a bit of research before asking here, and to explain what they found and why it hasn't solved the problem. There are several obvious candidates, starting with the neutral "choice", "option" or "item" or, referencing the pairing, "twin", or less neutral "assignation" or "opposite". Try looking these up in a thesaurus for further alternatives...
I'm not sure what you mean by "*interpret above with 'exist'*". Can you please [edit] your question to clarify?

Would you accept TVTropes as a canonical source for literary terms? They have an article about this: [This Is Reality](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki Main/ThisIsReality).
Suppose someone said "The immorality of Nazism".  Would you have the same problem that you appear to have with "the hyprocrisy of the left" and similar phrases?  I can't help you with the English, or the philosophy, but the phrase means the same as "The immorality of Nazis" or "The immorality of supporters of Naziism."  Thus the answer of Mari-Lou A seems to me to fit your question.
Can you explain what the idiom actually means? Is it the best combination of horse and rider? Which language/culture is it originally from?
The latter is obvious - not at all. Also, I'm sure the proverb doesn't mean 'kook' or 'crazy' (as those are very negative. What exactly is the intention of the proverb (you need to explain that).  Is it that the horse (the conveyance or means) must be strong and the rider (user of the tool, the knight or man) must be ... brave?
Are you talking about [Fibromyalgia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354780)?
Where are you living and working? "Boss" has been used as a more casual alternative to "sir" (and to some extent "madam") for many years in the UK. I've never heard "sup" in this context, though.
Why do you think both "an" and "a" are still in the running? The consonant sound at the beginning of "useful" should tell you than "an" is unacceptable.
Is the thing you want a name for different from the feasibility study you describe?  Possibly the correct plan is to educate your clients on what is meant by this technical term?
Would you mind explaining? Who are these customers? Small business owners, for example? I'm a firm believer in explanatory parentheses: feasibility study (whether the project is doable at reasonable cost)

an accepted cool pejorative <- I'm not really sure this makes sense. If a word is "accepted," then it's not such a good pejorative anymore. And "cool" is just an opinion. Are you asking if a significant number of people use it as a pejorative?
The important piece of information missing from your question is in what situation do you want to use these expressions? In everyday speech or in the novel you are writing. And by "can use" do you mean are they grammatically correct, or if you will be considered to be speaking "normal modern English" by native speakers?
As you allude to, the terms _stronger_ and _weaker_ are strictly relative. Is Batman weak? Not in any kind of absolute sense. However, strictly compared to Superman, he is. This is true with any superlative. Is our sun small? Certainly not, when compared with any other object in our solar system. However, when compared with other stars that are 100 times larger, it's minuscule. If you don't want to use the term "weaker", you can simply say "less strong", or otherwise clarify your position: _Batman is weaker than Superman, but still strong._ __or__ _Batman is less strong than Superman_.

Here is the chat: https://chat.stackexchange.com/?tab=site&host=english.stackexchange.com
So basically you're looking for a word meaning *exponential in base* (probably not understood without context). Basically, you're asking what is to logarithm what cube is to the cube root?
Can't you just use *(non-)integral* on the `log`? If you use it a lot you can even say `x=log` or `f(a,b)=log` and then refer to that. If you use it a whole lot more you can even consider an indicator function (take 1 when log is integer and 0 otherwise). It doesn't seem like something to be solved through the English language.
Example 5.4.1. A biased coin? Suppose a coin is either unbiased or biased, in which case the chance of a “head” is unknown and is given a uniform prior distribution. We assess a prior probability of 0.9 that it is unbiased, and then observe 15 heads out of 20 tosses — what is the chance that the coin is biased? (See page 95: https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/bugsbook_chapter5.pdf.)
In other words, are you asking if you refer to yourself in the third person, how should you conjugate? The answer clearly is that you conjugate in the third person - "Aunt Jalene tries to cook..."

@Mitsuko I'm sorry this question got closed, even though it is not a good fit for Stackexchange. It is way too open ended/broad, expecting creative answers (because there's no accepted existing well-known examples. It's like asking us for a poem. I thought it would be a popular 'fun' question, but too many just didn't get that. I'm not sure where to go from here though. Puzzles.SE? No, they expect that the asker knows the answer already. I bet the CIA has a list of these somewhere that they train their 'analysts' on. Did you just try googling (use a lot of different search terms)

This was a really weird thing to be wonder about, in my opinion. Definitely +1 for that. It's nerdiness level 100 on this one and I'm filled with utmost admiration and respect.

When you found these quotations, did they not give a publication date?  If you search the title, don’t you get some clues?
Realisation of potential failure might be a better way to put it. To me "realisation of failure" only applies to an actual failure, not a hypothetical one that was averted. Anyway, I know the feeling you are describing, but I don't have a single word for it - I have usually seen it described with multiple words, like the phrase you used "relief mixed with horror". You mentioned not wanting to use a non-English term: are you aware of any?
Welcome to EL&U. Are you asking about parts of a *grave* (the site of a burial), or parts of a *casket* / *coffin* (the box containing the corpse)? What are the Persian words? I cannot think of any widespread customs in the Anglo-American world that require the general public to have terms for different parts of either, but undertakers may have specialized terminology.
What is the question here?
Welcome to English Language & Usage. What does your research indicate it might mean? What is your best guess?
Why do you object to the comma preceding "my 300 pound wheelchair" but not "blood" or "my legs"? Also, your rephrasing is inaccurate; in the first version, the dashboard is presumably the minivan's; in your version, you make it the wheelchair's.
If this is legal jargon, have you tried the law SE?
I don't understand the tag here for etymology. What's there to research and study?The etymons for each of those four words are well known. The first three are from Germanic roots, the last Romance. Only a word can have an etymon. Phrases cannot. :)

If you're happy inventing "wandistry", what's wrong with "talismanistry" or "amuletry"?
Do they make the amulet / talisman magically as a magic item (ie in one go), or is it created first by a jeweller/gemsmith and then enchanted/imbued with the magic property later?
@Nik3141 Ah ok, that makes sense - they're not just taking everyday objects and enchanting then. They are actually creating something as the imbue it with magic (and so it could potentially lose it's magic by breaking?)
Do 'righteous' or 'pious' work? Does it have to fit the _-ital_ pattern?
This is confusing. It is unclear to me what you mean by 'right', especially give the previous examples. Do you mean right as in correct, right as in conservative or reactionary, right as in human rights? Also, your characterization of 'X-ism' as 'a view that gives priority to what is' is not really what '-ism' is about.
Count me as another of those who question the underlying assumptions of the question. That being said, would "moralism" fit your pattern?
@Learner 1) I don't think it is a significant restriction to say 'human rights' to the exclusion of animals or the environment. 'Human' rights' is just the way you say it. 2) Using 'right' in singular is not idiomatic English (which would explain a lot of the confusion) - one uses the plural refer to the concept. 3) You're not looking for an '-ism'? Al your examples are that and you didn't specify that you'd accept other suffixes or just any abstract noun for the concept. If you can give a good reason for otherwise then please elaborate.
Just thinking about this more, notice how in the CGEL example the present perfect isn't followed by the present participle, whereas in your example it is? Maybe this is a difference, in other words, as I said, it's often called the past perfect continuous or past perfect progressive because it combines the past perfect with the progressive or continuous use of the present participle, ie., (... has been writing...), not "has been here...."
Is there a section in this CGEL reference that refers specifically to present perfect progressive?  Because from my reading of your question, present perfect progressive will always fall into the "continuative" group.
So, 'I'm _<characteristic>_, so I can say _<a derogatory joke about said characteristic>_'?
Humbleness or humility? In German: "Demut"
Are you sure it is not simply a case of voluntarily seeming to fail to avoid being taken advantage of?
What was the definition of micromania that you found?
“In progress until recently” is critical to the author’s description of when the present perfect continuous is appropriate. How recently? Does the author give examples of when the criterion is not met?  Clearly it cannot be used with actions completed further in the past. What is said on this?
When you say the nouns are interchangeable, are you saying the nouns "coach" and "teacher" are interchangeable? Or are you saying that the verbal nouns (gerund forms) "coaching" and "teaching" are interchangeable? Either way, they may be interchangeable only insofar as they may be understandable, but I imagine some of the results of interchanging the two in random instances would be pretty unidiomatic in many cases.
Is this graph part of a computer game? If so are there parts of the game outside the graph or, if you leave the area under discussion, have you left the game altogether until you start another session?
Could you explain the context where you were thinking of using the phrase?
Is there a particular reason you want to divide into cuts or split into slices, when you could simply cut or slice?
Have you seen the [Interpersonal Skills](https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/) site?
Welcome to ELU! Could you add the phrases you have seen in your dictionary?
Can you supply the '...' that comes immediately before the 'Then are equivalent'? That could make a big difference. But as is, no it is not grammatical at all, and I've never seen it in math. All I've ever seen in math is as @JasonBassford figures "Then the following are equivalent:".
なしてや doesn't literally translate into English (and of course you know that), but it seems to me what you're looking for is a way to translate the rough manners of a country bumpkin (perhaps 芋兄さん) into more polite speech. Without going deeply into the differences between the two societies, I'd suggest you start with an abbreviated crudity and break off in the middle of it where you segue into the more acceptable, like so: "What the he—I mean, why?" (where "he" is the beginning of "hell" and is swallowed). The art is where you put the em dash interruption. "What the fu—I mean, why?" also works.
Where do we have dinner tonight? does not sound like something a native speaker would say. Of your examples  2-4,  I would normally use present continuous, and the last 2 only the present simple. But that's me.
Has the dinner been scheduled, as it might be on a tour? If so, okay.
Does the appeal to Shakespeare making up whatever he likes in the name of poetry hold weight? Etymonline just mentions Hamlet for 'primrose path'.
4 answers to:  the primrose as a symbol of debauchery and overindulgence?  None a conclusive citatable answer.
It means 'sky'? I've never come across that. Please could you add a link to whatever reference resource it comes from?
@defiant Can you give a link to that other question?
I'm confused...can you give an example of what you want to do, an actual sentence? 'Appeal' is a verb in English here, but 'argumentum' is a noun in Latin and used as a noun in English. Do you want to use 'argumentum' as a verb in English?
So you can win without the most points?
What does it mean to have "invented" a piece of language? If nobody has used it before it's an innovation, and may or may not become accepted. If people are commonly using it then it's not an invention.
Considering that "**is/are** able to" and "**might be** able to" mean quite different things, have you considered that they may have chosen the version that better  matches there intended sense here? Swap in the periphrastic alternative and see how it works out.
Can you give examples, as parallel as possible, where the '-en' infinitive _is_ used?
How does one say that in a sentence? The way you did works.
Whether it's "too verbose" is subjective. What context are you thinking of, in which that would sound too verbose?
So it’s a two-column list, Item and Price? list  of prices and price list are both okay (capitalize appropriately)
How about "One example has been done for you"?
Is there any difference in meaning between your two options? Can you describe a scenario where one reading would apply but not the other? Personally, I do not see a difference between a "situation of speaking" not exiting, and being in a "situation of not speaking".
Which book/author/whatever's classification scheme are you using? I ask because the one I'm most familiar with, in Huddleston and Pullum's *Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* (*CGEL*), says that these aren't actually distinct uses of the perfect, but rather, are just a set of often-overlapping factors that make the use of the perfect more likely. So in that context, your question may not be well-posed.
If you want to invent an opposite of *precede*, would not *postcede* be better?
You can look up this information in certain dictionaries ... do you mean to ask how to determine this based on some aspect of the word's form or meaning?
The word used on all forms, such as census returns, for example, has been 'sex' for as many years as there have been such forms - certainly two hundred years. What has changed to render that word, in the context you describe, inappropriate? You appear to want to ask about sex not gender, so just go ahead and do it.
Enter reprimand in Google.  You will get a list of sources; click on any link that offers a definition of reprimand.  For example, you will find this [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reprimand) link that defines reprimand.  Now do the same for criticize.  If the difference between the two is still unclear, edit your question to explain what you do not understand.  Or, do you not have Google?
Hmm. I think this ***is*** a duplicate of [When should a verb be followed by a gerund instead of an infinitive?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/329/). The top answer there says ***Sometimes the meaning changes according to the verb [form] used*** - giving as examples *He won't remember **giving** the homework to Mr. Young / He won’t remember **to give** the homework to Mr. Young*. The potential semantic distinction is also addressed on ELL: [Why is “He knows to swim” incorrect?](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/31852/) (which it *isn't* necessarily, obviously! :)
what about "warm lot" sounds negative? Warmness is a positive trait. That is like assuming a "wonderful lot" would be insulting. It would be informal in nearly any usage, but it  being derogatory is all to do with how you describe the group rather than that they *simply are a group*.
Did any dictionary entries seem to explain this usage?
You mean 'nice' or 'cute'?
Why doesn't nice or cute work? Could you add the sentence that you want to use this in?
Most times when I see a query like this, it is comparing guys with dogs. Saying a guy is _puppyish_ is more common when describing a cute guy in terms of animals. Then we have horses: we can say a guy is a _stud_, or maybe a _stallion_.  Or how about bulls...?
Are they bottle glass chippings?
Okay, I had that 2nd question about an hour ago, then dozed off, woke up startled--Huh, what!?--and pressed the add comment button...a little late. Sorry, I'm gonna have to look into getting some of that glass whatever-it-is...
Did it look like this? The best photo I could find so far by searching "Fossite" online: https://www.flickr.com/photos/lwr/315149796/sizes/o/.
@Salomo - Can we say that the new result "*gives light to*" (or "*sheds light on*") Fact A and Fact B? Would that help?
So we need an analyze the syllables ... phon-ics, closed syllable; pho-neme, open syllable.  But why do we rule out pho-nics? https://blog.allaboutlearningpress.com/open-and-closed-syllables/
To clarify: Are you attempting to connect English n. _tyre/tire_ to the _Rad_ ‘wheel’ in _gerädert_?
You say ***...and so on***. What does that mean if we add another "table" of, say, four *blue* cells to the "network"? Would each blue cell have a connection to each of the *red* cells (thinking of that set as the "backbone" of the network), or to either (not both) the yellow or green cells (thinking of the whole system as a "layered" network)? There's probably an SO site devoted to AI / neural nets, and they'd probably have standard terminology for at least *some* aspects of this "network topology" situation.
That's not what I meant. If we add four more cells (blue, say) to your example, would each of them connect to all cells in the existing *middle* (red) row, or all cells in either the first or second row (or both of them)? That's essentially what I would say defines the "network topology" here. You don't currently have a "fully connected" network, since none of the green cells connect directly to any of the yellow cells.
This comes from the writing stack and follows what @KateBunting is saying. What if you separated the indignant reaction from the berating? _The lead girl was indignant. "I can't believe..., " she berated him._
Would you be more specific with *part* and perhaps distinguish between a few alternatives? For instance, for a mission involving multiple aircraft, each aircraft's departure and mission is a *sortie*. Then a mission may involve multiple *tasks*. Finally, you may actually be seeking a word for something made of multiple missions, like a *campaign* or *operation*.
Have you checked some good dictionaries or other sources for the correct pronunciation?
The question is not 'How are you?', but 'Who are you?'
Did you find *complimentary* (a broad term)? Specific reasons might also be described as *promotional* or *on warranty*.
Personally, I don't know what "ease the consideration ..." means here. What do you mean by that?
Okay. And so in *easing the consideration of the ball radius*, you're saying that the radius has a *smaller* (but not nonexistent) role in the calculation of the distance between the ball surface and the plane?
I think I should flag this question as not being a sufficiently clear question.  There are two problems with it.  First, You have not provided any context that would enable anyone to grasp what the meanings are supposed to be.  Given that the prose is technical, that does not make it bad writing per se, but your question needs to make clear what the problem is.  I can guess it has something to with the motion of a ball (calculating it?).  Second, you have not shown what steps you have taken to work this out for yourself.
Also now misnamed - Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec for 9th 10th 11th and 12th months?! Maybe 'ber' should mean ' two out of kilter'..?
Are you sure that the report is from 1947? While that is the original publication date for Official Records, Issues 24-26 may be 24-26 years after this (assuming annual publication), putting it at 1971-1973. I ask this because I thought I'd found an earlier publication through Google Books, and was fooled by the same thing - in my case, The Progressive started in 1929, but the excerpt was from an issue in the early 1970s. Google Books is notoriously tricky with indexing periodicals properly.
You said "non-adjective"; presumably you don't want adverbs either?
I would read it as referring to all of them. What do you mean about the other words being "in positive"? They're all pretty negative with or without the "most".
Does this only exist in Brazilian Portuguese or does it exist in original Portuguese? If it only exists in the Brazilian dialect I wonder whether it's origins might be in pre-Columbian culture.
Why is *barrier* in your sample sentence?
Erm..."senior citizen"?
Are you looking for a specific phrase you have heard before? If so, can you remember any details at all (if a particular word stands out, what situation it was used in, whether it was humourous, how old the person was that said it, which country it was said in, etc)?
Is it related to affluenza?
I have no idea what you are talking about. Who is "we" and where are you? Also, in English, we don't say water and sewage organization. We say water and sewage pipes or layout of water and sewage pipes. Please improve  your question. Thank you. utility hook-ups are also a "thing".
Check out [What Is a Document Control System?](https://www.mastercontrol.com/gxp-lifeline/what-is-a-document-control-system-/) and similar.
Possible duplicate of [When do I use "can" or "could"?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1/when-do-i-use-can-or-could) Strictly speaking, ***can*** is the "correct" form in your context. But native speakers often aren't that precise, so it's quite common / natural to reflect / parallel the preceding (HYPOTHETICAL) ***would + if*** forms by using ***could*** in the final clause. Much the same choice would apply with ***might / may*** in this context.
Could you add the date it was published?
I can’t see the sentence in the link you provided. Which meaning of quarter does it refer to?
What else could I mean? But I guess I really mean: another example. By the way, the OED defines "to be for" as: c. to be for: to be ready to act for, to be on the side of, or in favour of, to advocate. Same structure as to be against.
Allow me to ask you: How do you distinguish: "She was against the idea." from "It was against the door."? Hm? Structurally the same, semantically different. By the way, if you had said predicative complement **as subject**, it would have been clearer to me.
And I am saying, how do you deal **with the fact** that the two things have the same structure but cannot be explained grammatically the same way (according to some?)? The only interesting fact about all this is that difference in meaning between the two. I think it comes from the verb be versus no be: "be + against an idea" + [sitting] against the wall, which does not require **be**.
unless they're *followed* by by"" : Do you mean "*preceded* by "by"" ?
Does "He got up off the floor" mean he had fallen down in a drunken stupor?
Did you find it when you looked in a dictionary?
Why is this question important to you? Why should it matter to us? Describing more fully why you want to know this might help someone else become interested. It might also provide clues for what you mean by "valid morphology."
Does this globe really exist, or is it a hypothetical example? It seems odd to have *three* buttons in this situation. Given the light is already a toggle, why wouldn't a manufacturer use the same type of switch for *Spin Start/Stop* as well as *Light On/Off*?
More importantly, why are there three spellings for "there"?
What model does this software pretends to implement for those box options ? This should be in the documentation and if not I would simply run the "uninstall" and look for another soft.
This is a very broad question, including anything under the sun; can you tighten up your definition of non-financial risk a little?
Transaction costs are indeed the barrier to most forms of arbitrage. Have you backtested your strategy with historical data?
How did you produce the chart? With R?
Did you define a maximum global and per position sharpe ratio and exposition you want to achieve ?
Just curious, what other asset classes do you refer to?
Could u give more details on the considered payoff/& models ?
Just to make sure I (and everybody) understand. You mean that some markets will be closed while other will be open, and since your strategy is spread over different markets, you're "struggling" to compute the statistics of the returns is that right?
I am also interested in this approach. Do you have published references that you are following or any publicly accessible work of your own?
Just to make sure I understand: say, market is 20.00 - 20.01, you submit a buy order at 20.00, market moves up (and away from your order), and you not only get no execution, but also pay a fee?
OK, so the market is 20.00 - 20.01 and you post a bid at 20.00. If you're not super-fast, then you're likely to end up far in the back of the stack, and you're likely to get executed only when the market is going against you from 20.00-20.01 to 19.99 - 20.00 and loose money because of that. So you loose either way. Not much incentives for trading, right?
so if r_i and r_j are the returns of each stock, you are looking for the expected value of the product of these two? i.e. E(r_i*r_j) ?
How many factors are you looking at? What do you mean by performance? Speed? Accuracy? Hedging performance?
I like the question, but please avoid the acronyms like "ML", "RL", it makes it difficult to read. I corrected the onea I knew but "LOB"? no idea. You could also create links for the papers to improve the quality of the question.
If the S&P is currently at 1350 and you believe it will fall to 1275 in the near future, wouldn't you rather *short* the index?!
You mean like [FAST](http://fixprotocol.org/fast/)?
Isn't a lot of the explanatory power for y going to live in the error term from the multivariate regression and therefore effectively do the same as just solving the numerical relationship by minimizing the tracking error? What were you hoping to gain with this?
You can't infer the future based on past results; that's just one of the harsh realities of backtesting. As for how much data is needed for a reliable backtest, see [How much data is needed to validate a short-horizon trading strategy?](http://quant.stackexchange.com/q/1891/35)
Where do you see a patent for a trading system? I'm genuinely curious.
Would you like to make the question more specific? E.g. what is the relation between PCA and the following method in information theory? - otherwise, as you rightly notice, it looks like a collection of buzz words and the quest for unified theory of everything.
are you sure that UX1 is a 1 month constant maturity? At least on my bloomberg settings it simply points to the "next" future, and therefore it jumps to the next contract on expiration date. Therefore it is not quite a constant maturity instrument.
Any chance you could compare against one of the big hedge-fund indices?
What are you trying to measure?
Because a negative number raised to a non-integer exponent is complex. Of what use would regressing physical economic values have here?
There are too many questions.   I think you need to narrow it down to one question at a time.   Also, you need to be more specific about where this power company is operating.  In the U.S.?   If so, which state.    Is it publicly owned, a co-op, private?    If out of the U.S., which country?    When you mentioned exporting LNG, is this company buying LNG that was imported, or is the company buying from a company that also exports LNG abroad?   I doubt I can answer your final question, but I think you get the idea of how much information is missing.
What if you just generated random portfolios, scaled their weights to 1, then blended that with the risk-free return to generate the target volatility?
@Nikos what do you mean by "expressing" complex quant equations?
There seems to be answers your link. You aren't satisfied with them? This topic is more relevant over there.
What kind of a reference are you looking for? There's a lot of stuff on SDEs with jumps out there...
At first glance it's difficult to see whether using PCA makes any sense here. Could you please explain what you are trying to achieve? Generate similar data?
Do you know what a *risk model* is, or how to do *principal component analysis*? It sounds like you just want to hedge against few *factors*. So pick some sector ETFs that replicate your portfolio's primary risk factors.
I can write a sketch of a MATLAB code, would it help you?
What about Stochastic Dynamic Programming developed by Bertsekas et al? If you know the distribution of the stochastic process exactly, you specify admissible controls for the trader - and then you get the optimal solution. The theory is very rigorous and works for analytic spaces, so it shall be enough for your case. By the way, I would say that one needs to know joint probabilities rather than 1-time-moment distributions.
Shouldn't it be "-" the variance term?!?
Would encryption as a remedy qualify?
My understanding of Newey-West estimators is that it is used to calculate the covariance matrix of parameters in a regression. I could imagine using it in a robust portfolio optimization (concerned with uncertainty in the mean parameters), but whether it makes sense to use it for estimating the covariance of returns, I don't know. That being said, why are you not able to simply replace the sample covariance in the shrinkage formula with your new Newey-West estimate?
Why are there still travel agents? Why are there still physical books? For that matter, why does NYSE still have floor brokers?
Sorry Do I understand correctly... you get a massive p-value for the test so you cannot reject $H_0$ which is non-stationarity... why do you think it is stationary ?
Your edit makes your question even more confusing: 100 call options (each contract representing 10 shares) and a strike price of 25 pounds makes that a cost of 25k pounds not 250k. Same with the proceeds you receive upon selling the delivered shares at market price. Also, you should read up on the basics of risk adjusted return measures. You need to generate a string of returns before you can calculate the variation of such returns. So, I still do not understand what you try to achieve here???
Out of curiosity, what are the potential use cases for such a product?
you have seen this on which market / orderbook?
This is a really badly worded question. What does it mean to estimate the volume we can 'safely trade'. What is safe trading? Why are you constricting yourself to a 'single trade'? Why would you want to trade all your size in 1 trade? It is just not clear what you're asking.
What kind of data do you look for exactly, which region, attributes? You probably have tried World Bank, FRED, EuroStat etc. already, right?
If it is not homework, perhaps you want to share some more information, else why not just go with this? 1-pnorm((<end>-<start>)/100,mean=E(r_stock),sd=(<beta>*<vola>))
could you give a link to some paper on the model ?
Why do you need an alternative? Do you need some data that is not available in Bloomberg? Is it a cost issue?
and what do you want to analyse? Perhaps you could also rephrase your question to "Best practice approach for calculating the PE-ratio" - you could then apply this method to the historical data. Also I would be interested in seeing a "citeable" reference - perhaps someone here knows one
I don't remember the exact source, but I think Duffie wrote a nice paper (maybe the original one?) on Arrow-Debreu securities and equilibria in an incomplete market.
So basically you are looking for a random variable $p$ that will give you the following result $\sum_{t=1}^T Z_t(\omega)^{1-p(\omega)}=T$ for all $\omega \in \Omega$ ?
could $p$ be a vector of length $T$ ?
I don't think quants are (or should) approach this any differently from stats / math researchers. There is a lot of research exploring this topic and each optimization method has different properties. The problem is if you use several runs of an algorithm, you are kind of creating a new optimization algorithm, right? Then why wouldn't you just use it in the first place? And you get into a circular thinking...
why don't you just apply the geometrix mean formula directly ?
Don't you know $\delta$?  You have to estimate $A$, where $A \leq 1$?
this looks like some type of poisson distribution to me - however it does not seem to be normalized to 1 ?
Elliot wave principle seems pretty informal to me. What exactly do you want to compute? Perhaps you can extend your question?
What do you mean by optimal monte carlo? Duration matching is usually the standard. I know some also use swaptions to match the increase in the swap yields (which is linked to prepayment speed)
What process do you use to simulate short rate   r ? And what is the problem with your simulation?
OIS is used via dual-curve stripping in the inversion to produce Black vols.  The alternative is LIBOR vols.  Black vol is the alternative to Normal (Bachelier?) vol.  It's not as simple as using the OIS numbers, one needs to re-derive the pricing formulae in the presence of multiple curves etc via no-arbitrage. FINCAD wrote a good primer paper on it.
Are you only using it for charting?  Node.js has not yet (as of June 2014) reached version 1.  I know it is widely used for web development but I would be hesitant to rely on it for trading purposes.
In the process of teaching yourself, what model are you investigating? A general question will only get you general answer.
I get an error that the max. number of iterations was exceeded?!?
Now it runs - what is your exact question? Whether this replicates the algorithm described in the paper?
I completely disagree. What's the point in contesting and doing the re-edit? you'll get your answer anyway. We mods are trying to classify things as well as possible, not to fight with you. I'll leave it like that in the title if you want.
Why do you want to use the "classical" approach? The portfolio weights are super sensitive to the inputs of expected return. You can never trade that portfolio with any good economic sense. Can you elaborate on the dynamic portfolio optimization and the constraints in question please?
What would you choose the T in the definition of an arbitrage to be, to ensure that you will not loose money? :)
Is that T a valid choice for the no arbitrage definition?
Can you please clarify notation "$<dz_t,dW_t>$" is Quadratic Variation?
Does it get negative even for a large nSims?
Can you post a link to the book which you mean?
Does it make sense to use implied volatility to price an option when the former is derived from the option price itself?
I think you are missing the quadratic variation term in Ito's lemma? Its $+\frac{1}{2}\partial_{SS}\xi_t dt$
It depends on how heating oil and jetfuel are correlated in their example. Can you post the full question?
What makes you think it is not a martingale? $\tilde S$ is a martingale, and so is the portfolio process.
Risk Analyst is quite vague in fact in my opinion. What are you doing on a daily basis?
Assuming that anybody actually found any such benefits I believe it is unlikely to show up in research or media soon. And even if, how would you rate a single observation against the unknown population size of users who tried? If you really want to resolve this, I suggest that you run a survey.
What is this book? Looks like Filipotic's
What exactly do you want to hedge? It sounds a little bit as if you were just talking about classical portfolio optimization which makes use of the covariance matrix.
I am asking you! How do you define *risk*?
While you cannot *maximize return* and *minimize risk* at the same time I think what you mean sounds like optimizing your sharpe ratio in a mean-variance-framework. Are you aware of Modern portfolio theory: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory ?
Ok then I changed it back, but aren't you looking to compute *the expectation of the return give the return is below $z$*?
Well then isn't that the definition of conditional expectation?
Isn't the point exactly the assumption that it *will* hit $H$ at some point?
What constraints does Bloomberg add that you would like removed?
What possible reason would borrowing options serve? I bet you can fulfill your objective in a more straightforward way
Can you please write out specifically your likelihood function, and your simulation algorithm? Otherwise, we are not able to isolate the problem.
But to deal with your question: What framework do you have? In the programming language R for example, you can use the command order() to rank the sectors, for seasonal decomposition you can do all kinds of stuff. As a first step I would use a moving average or the decompose() function of the stat package. As far as scaling is concerned, you will divide by the number of sectors at some point - but you can do it in different ways. The question is: do you want to preserve the information that the sector has a PMI that indicates growth or do you just want to see the ranking.
Adapt to do _what_?
What makes you think that MAs should work anyway?
How can you justify calibrating vol of vol to a bunch of vanilla options, which have no vol of vol exposure? It would make a lot more sense to me to calibrate to vol/var swaps.
Have you checked out the following paper? http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2219548
Thanks. Is it possible to have the definition for par yield as well?
Did you already look into jump models or central tendency models?
Could you specify in what respect you are comparing the different models (fit to vanilla options, parameter stability, use for pricing exotic options, etc)? If your goal is to get the best fit of a model in terms of pricing errors for vanilla options, models with jumps in the asset price process are definitely advisable for the short end.
@JWally what do you mean  by "open" are these Open Interest numbers or how many options you have Open already?
Why don't you wanna use Merton model?
Hint: if you discount something's price by 50%, you have to raise the price 100% (of the reduced price) to get it back to the original price. Does that help?
Your link provides only 34 pages.  Where is page 68?
So you're basically looking for an analytical solution for $\frac{\partial \frac{\Delta}{C(S,t)}}{\partial K} = 0$, right?
Do you mean what *assures* you that the CFD contract is indeed going to change exactly as described?
What do you mean *forecast underlying asset price movement*, you mean  you can know $S_T$ at titme $t$?
What sort of corporate events are you looking for?
It is not clear what you are asking. Where do you get the conclusion that the nth swap rate equal the par rate? You may see it somewhere, but it is usually related to certain background explained in detail.
What do you mean by "bar" here?
And also even if you do all that, I'm not sure how exactly does the Monte Carlo from an estimated lognormal random variable will help you in pinning down the "exact" (or somewhere near there) of the next day closing price. You do your Monte Carlo for say 10^10 times, and you'll get a bunch of realizations. Then what do you do? You take the sample mean of this? You'd just effectively get back your estimated mean that you'd used from the historical data (i.e. Law of Large Numbers).
@Jojo I am not sure what you are doing. I guess with bar you mean candlesticks. It is unclear to me how you would forecast the closing price of the day $t+1$ from the candlestick at $t$. What is your model about?  As `user32416` pointed out your approach sounds like technical analysis. Furthermore, why are you assuming a log norm distribution? Have you tried to plot your model output f.ex. as a simple histogram? Please clarify before we can help you in detail!
Maybe some clarification would make it easier to help you. Why do you think that the $(i,j)$ entry is equal to this sum of squared elements? I agree to your point that the output of this small function is the last sum you gave in your question. So, what exactly is your question?
Isn't the documentation of the package clarifying what is being done inside?
Hi @tacos_tacos_tacos, welcome to quant.SE! I am wondering why your statement should be true that one strictly prefers a contract that expires later to one that expires earlier, given you know for sure that the underlying security will become worthless between the two expiration dates...what is the justification of that?
All right, then you should mention that you are talking about american option, because in the european style you are only allowed to exercise at expiration date. Regarding your question, are you thinking about measuring the impact of the option related variables onto future stock prices? I can not provide any citations, but why not simply regression future returns on the characteristics? This would allow to draw inference about the effects?
The Protter paper is available at https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/9176/TR001296.pdf?sequence=1.
In a continuous time model a 1-week rate is a long term rate! The spot rate is literally an instantaneous rate; where can I go to borrow for the next infinitesimal interval dt? ;-)
Just out or curiosity, how will Shannon entropy separate the signal from the noise in financial returns? I've not heard that thesis before.
What is your proxy for the true volatility ?
Is there a liquid market for these options? You could calibrate your favorite option model to this market.
From where did you take this problem?
Are $r$ and $\delta_u$ deterministic or stochastic?
What do you mean with zero value? The price is not zero for all derivatives.
Given your question, most likely i am completely misunderstanding you. But is the price of a call option not bigger than 0? i.e. you have to pay something to enter the contract? Or a bond, you got to pay something to now to get the payoff at the end. Maybe when you are talking about "value" you mean something else then when I am talking about "price"
It is  not clear to me...Why don't you know the realized returns ?
What do you mean "the strike price for a European call option" and strike price $K$? Is the first strike price just the price? Is the interest rate also zero?
should this be a comment to another question?
Extreme Value theory is concerned with the prob. dist. of the maximum (or minimum) of several random variables. For example the rainfall in centimeters is measured every day at a certain location; what can we say about the maximum yearly rainfall (that is the max of the 365 daily values for one calendar year)? Large deviations theory, I am less familiar with, is concerned with the behavior of their tails of the distribution of a r.v. as a parameter N becomes large. The Central Limit theorem tells you what happens to the mean, the LD Theory tells you about the tails.
Quibble with Assumption 2.1: if the payoff is less than the risk-free interest rate, could the price be negative (you'd have to pay someone to take it to make up for the interest they would lose)?
Is something special in this setting that does not allow you to compute the Expected Value under the martingale measure? I do not see  where a problem creeps in.
So you are interested in an analytical solution rather than in a numerical one? Numerically it should be fine to simulate paths and to compute the expected value even if you have many stochastic parameters. Unfortunately I am not familiar with analytical solutions.
That is true. But how can we assume that $Y(t)$ is a geometric Brownian motion? It is based on the form of the SDE, where stochastic integration is used.
Have you tried using a Student-t or another fat tailed distribution instead of the Normal?
Can I have the names of the books that you are working on?
I do not know what does it mean super-replication price or sub-replication price. Can you please define them in your question?
Are you asking for a good first estimate to computing the inverse of the normal distribution?
What is the relationship between $t$ and $\tau$? Is $\tau = T-t$?
What have you tried so far? I mean there are obvious parameters missing from your input here, do you realized that? Maybe you should have a look at the model definition again and include it in your question. It would help you start for sure.
Risk-averse does not means that you avoid taking up any additional risk, or taking up the lowest risk investment. As long as the coefficient of a risk is fairly compensated, rational investors does not mind taking up additional risk. And it depends solely on the risk appetite of each individual investors. However some sources have the wrong idea that risk-averse refers to investors dislike and avoids risk, which isn't really the case. As long as the risk is fairly compensated, why not?
You may need to define the notations. For example, what are $L$, $C$, $C^*$, and what is the difference between $C^*(T, K,S)$ and $C^*(\tau, K,S)$?
You may look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9969962/simulation-of-garch-in-r?rq=1
What do you mean shorting 1 call of the "same maturity" but only at "each maturity date"? What does "each maturity date" mean?
The second formula looks suspicious to me. Can you check?
What are the values for  the points intercept the X and Y axis?
Can you Google bs and provide me a link?
I concur with gg user - can you give a reference to the quote in your question?
Do you use stochastic control theory to solve your problem? Could you edit your post and write down how you get this pde (in details)?
Anything new in this subject?
Maybe you should write your question (only PDE with boundary condition $V(T,x)=\log(x)$, without financial mathematics background) on this site: http://math.stackexchange.com/?newreg=7eefc143c8c7428ab8c1a2b0b58896df . More interesting question is whether your PDE has unique solution or not. If yes, we can look for it and then compute $V_{x}/ xV_{xx}$. To solve your PDE we have to substitute some function for $V(t,x)$ to eleminate non-linear part $V_{x}^{2}/V_{xx}$. I hope that somebody will help us with this task.
For (b), both $\tau$ and $T$ appeared in $e^{a\tau}S^{-5}e^{10S_T}$. Is it a typo? Why do you need the $\tau$?
Can you let me know what the $\tau$ in $e^{a\tau}S^{-5}e^{10S_T}$ should be? If the question is not clear, then it is difficulty to answer.
Could you please add a reference for Allan Malz paper? thanks
What do you get when applying Ito's Lemma ?
I don't understand how you ran into such an integral by applying Ito's lemma and integrating both sides. Could you provide more details on your calculations?
Are you sure for the factor $2$ in your $dY_t/Y_t$ equation? Plus, it is not clear at all what you are asking: what is $X_t$ and what is $x$. If you just invest in the portfolio, $Y_t$ isn't your wealth equal to $Y_T - Y_0$ over the period $[0,T]$ ? In that case you just need to find the expression of $Y_T$. If you took this exercise from a book/notes, please provide a reference, because it is very fuzzy as such.
Should $h(T-1)$ be $h(T-t)$ in (1)?
On the first hypothetical, have you forgotten to say that Party 1 pays 1 at maturity in addition to the 6 month libor semi-annually?   Otherwise it doesn't make sense economically.
Can you provide other tests/empirical analyses on indeces and stocks? It is too poor a reason that indeces returns "behave better" than stocks' and your results may be just a case.
Do you want historical estimates or some sort of prediction scheme? The latter is probably out of scope here.
Is that for real?
How fast is your montecarlo? And how many iterations does your calibration take?
Hi and welcome. Very nice effort (1) Solving the Black-Scholes equation can be done without any stochastic calculus, just plain probabilities and integration, see here: http://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/22830/black-scholes-formula-proof-without-stochastic-integration. (2) I don't really understand your method, could you describe it step by step? Seems to me like a classic Monte Carlo (3) Inaccuracies could come from: there is no proper risk-free rate, so banks price according to their own funding costs; there are 252 trading days in a year not 365; did you account for dividends etc.
Looking at the method you suggest, I think it is pure chance that your price resembles that observed in the market. Could you describe step 1 in more details, are you just sampling from a Gaussian and measuring the probability of a Gaussian variable being greater than the strike price, or are you using a Gaussian draws to sample from a more elaborate distribution (lognormal). Plus, how do you compute the payout in step 2?
...... but rather lognormal. (2) You cannot isolate the computation of the probability that $S_T > K$ from the rest, because you do not have a constant payout, but ones which precisely depends on the value of $S_T$ when $S_T$ is greater than $K$. In other words you seem to compute $E[\max(S_T-K,0)] = (S_T-K) Prob[S_T > K]$ and compute the probability using MC, but I don't understand how you compute the associated Payout (+ this payout seems wrong from your comment?)
@Dabshffabjvs could you insert the reference of the article which tells you how to choose an "optimal measure" which resembles the real world measure?
I guess that by "massive amount of stock prices" you mean "massive amount of stock paths" hence simulations, right?
what do you mean explode? as this is essentially lognormal, it can become significantly large on some paths, however, by average it should be reasonable.
Can you please define Jensen's alpha, in a mathematical formula?
Thanks for clarification. Is the answer below helpful for you?
Could you please use Latex to format your equations? It's very hard to understand what you want exactly. Does this help you: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/412470/conditional-distribution-in-brownian-motion ?
You must be doing something wrong. Are you sure you use the same kind of data in input e.g. annualised rates and volatilities, rates expressed in % and not in absolute values etc. Also, is it the MC which fails or the PDE, I mean did you compare to analytic BS price?
I'm curious- why would you want to do this?  How would the underlying stocks evolve  (i.e. what is the model)?  How would they react to simulated bids?  What do you hope to learn that can't be observed from the actual NYSE?
You're discretisation scheme seems weird to me. As you've defined it, the SDE for $\sigma_t$ is a simple GBM. So why would you bother with a Milstein scheme? Euler on log-returns should be fine (ie replace $\times (1+...) $ by $\exp (...) $ and get rid of the $z (k-1)^2$
It looks like you are getting some good advice here. Hopefully, you resolved your issue. I am very curious to see your implementation of the SABR model. Would you be willing to share it?
Could you provide a working link to the document?
It's also worth mentioning that on the other end of the spectrum (far ITM), the model assumptions matter less and less (since it's almost only intrinsic value), so you would not observe such a behaviour, even with a low liquidity. But obviously using intraday data will bring in some noise. Are you using bid/ask data? Because you still have weird stuff going on at the money
I am also looking for that information. The data on the MSCI webpage goes only back until 2002 or so but the index started much earlier (1969 according to wikipedia). I found historical returns on a bunch of sites but they all go back only a few years. Does anyone know how to access the full history?
Looks like in the example you are only Long stocks. Don't you also have to Short to be beta neutral?
Not really. The best model is the one which allows you to defend your margin. Have you read the paper by Rebonato?
you mean at the limit ?
@LocalVolatility did you manage to learn more on this topic? I'm even more interested than before since I'm currently exploring better ways to fit flagship European indices, that currently exhibit a strong concavity on the put wing for the May17 expiry due to French presidential elections.
Where is the t in the rhs of your equation ?
Which numbers would your strategy be using when released into the real world? Would a raw price actually be realised? Or would it be reversed/altered before you can act on it?
All I'm saying is that you need to run your back testing on the same thing it will be running on when it goes live. Of you can't, then you need the closest to it you can get. If you don't have equivalent data to what you're going to run it on when live, then what does your back test really represent?
Do you have any sets at all where you have both to compare? Or nothing at all? What would happens you were to run your algorithm and it encounters a price that gets adjusted? Would you actually realise it? I guess that's the important question.
Does the [Margin calculator](http://www.cboe.com/tradtool/mcalc/default.aspx) at the same CBOE site do what you need?
Did you check if returns are somewhat autocorrelated, if yes did you add a conditional mean process (ex a MA(1) ) to remove it ?
If $\lambda$ and $\nu$ are measures, then $\lambda(\omega)$ and $\nu(\omega)$ do not make good sense. What do you mean $\lambda(S_T^0)$? Is $S_t^0$ a numeraire process?
The notation $\omega \in \mathcal{F}_t(\omega)$ does not make sense to me. Note that $\mathcal{F}_t$ consists of events, which may be uncountable. Then how can you take a sum on them? It is better to make it crystal clear and let you professor know. Otherwise, how can you write your PhD thesis later on?
As long as your market model is *complete* you can always hedge an option. In that case all latent risks can indeed be neutralised by trading in either a specific instrument or a specific combination of them. Are you familiar with the concept of *state prices*?
You mean the total notional of structured debt emitted by a particular entity ?
Are you interested in calculating the curve's length, for any kind of curve?
What do you want to calibrate the model to -historical returns or option prices?
Some authors use $\alpha$ where some other authors use $1-\alpha$. Are you sure your expressions for g(x) and CVaR use compatible notation?
Have you read this https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=956825 ? Have you searched this forum for previous questions identical to yours ?
Are you saying that cash and bonds are riskless because, although there is a standard deviation, you are capping the loss at 0? This problem seems very unrealistic, so I would appreciate more details. Is there an original question?
It is not clear what you are trying to achieve here IMHO. Am I right to believe that you are trying to use the "most-likely path approximation" to calculate the implied BS volatility from a local volatility surface and an input Gamma kernel $q(x_t,t;x_T;T,K)$?
That's not $r_P$, its $r_T$ so you will have  $Cov(r_T, r_T*)$. Is this a homework?
1. Are you familiar with calendar arbtirage opportunities (both expressed in terms of total variance in the (log-forward-)moneyness x time space and in terms of option prices)? 2. I think that if you gave precise example it would help steer the discussion. What I mean is that it is possible to observe such a phenomenon as an artefact of the method used for deriving the implied forward curve and volatility surface in the first place.
It's an interesting question. Just to be sure I understood, you are trying to view this as an "optimal control" problem, where $S_t$ emerges as the optimal policy guaranteeing that $P\&L_0$ verifies certain properties (value function)? And you are now asking, to what value function do each standard models for $S_t$ correspond? For starters, did you happen to read Lorenzo Bergomi's "Stochastic Volatility Modeling"? In the first chapter (http://media.wix.com/ugd/c4ff5c_ba17141422d44ba99daf19ee2b931544.pdf) he explains some ideas around Black-Scholes that may be of interest to you?
I just went through section 1.1 and I fail to see where he imposes any dynamics? IMHO he only postulates that the expectation of future, squared, realised arithmetic returns converges to some value ($\approx$ finite quadratic variation in stochastic calculus). This is similar to what you get when you impose the LHS to be zero under some measure $Q$ in the PnL equation you mention: If discounted asset prices are martingales under $Q$ ($dS_t - S_t r dt = (...)dW_t^Q$), then the premium needs to be defined as $\pi_0 = E^Q[ e^{-\int_0^T r_s ds} \phi(S_T) ]$ to have $E^Q[P\&L_0]=0$.
Is your integral intended to be pathwise, and therefore PL0 a random variable, or is there an expectation missing?
Thx. Is S a state vector or just the underlying? Can I use an ATM European option to hedge the vol of another one? Can I use a European option to hedge an exotic?
I don't see where on p. 284 in Alexander (2008) it says anything about using a binomial tree to price European options under a stochastic volatility model. Since there are two state variables (spot and vol.) I would expect to see something like a 2-dimensional tree if anything. But more commonly, you'd use either Monte Carlo or finite differences. Could you please clarify?
Do you have any basis between NIBOR or LIBOR?
So just to clarify, you want to obtain a 6M Curve with only 3M quotes. Do you have any product with 6M yields implied? If you don't you might obtain the 6M NIBOR by just compouding the 3M to 6M and assuming that 1x4FRA x 4xFRA = 6M Rate.
i get your point, it just reminds me of how 3M libor use to be against 6M libor when the credit spread wasn't taken into account. Would you say that (1+FRA3M) x (1+FRA3M) doesnt work at all?
Without even looking at the parameters you chose (how did you come up with the interest rate and why do you not account for dividends?), you are comparing an American **put** price to a European **call** price. I fail to see how this could work. In your setting $r=0.01, q=0$, pricing a put would give you: 4.5643 which is indeed a lower bound for the American counterpart.
Have a read through section 0.5 here: https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/howison/barriers.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwjwrMvAw7jRAhVCAsAKHbwADtAQFggeMAE&usg=AFQjCNFwqEKeiAvbDX6tgDceMI59GBG2rw. Does it help you? Although pricing is conducted under GBM modelling assumptions you should have no problem translating what's done to your ABM dynamics
When you define the $V(t, T)$ - did you actually mean $c(t, T)$?
Say you were to approach this with brute-force... what would make one options trade better than another?
How do you rank the tickers?
The premium should equal the risk. If there was a known area where risk were (temporarily) undervalued, the  the market would buy it and the price would be pushed up until it was fair. That is, why is anyone going to sell you something for less than it's expected value?
Are you aiming to calibrate a model to current option prices, such that you can accurately predict option prices conditional of the future spot price? Ie you want a model that has the property of being accurate after the spot changes?
Can you please provide more background information? Where are these equations from? What is $V$ for each case? Is $r=r(t)$?
I assume these are profits/losses in dollars each day. But what is the _Equity_ (or _Capital_) under management to which these P&Ls are being applied? How much money did you assume to start with and how much is it now? The Equity must remain positive at all times or you are out of business.
I assume that your last $t$ should be a $T$?
My intuition is that the delta should be non-negative. See e.g. http://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/30177 - though this answer doesn't list a result that explicitly covers barrier options. Although you say not to check the code I can see a few mistakes in it already at first glance. 1) The expression for $\mu$ seems to have the wrong sign. 2) In $\partial D / \partial S$, you a missing brackets around $\sigma \sqrt{\tau}$ in the denominator. There are probably more.. Also - your last two lines don't make sense to me. You show a different result for the same inputs?
Is this correctly specified?  The probability of a geometric brownian hitting zero is zero, so the price of this contract is trivially 1.
For my info/out of curiosity: on what venues does high-speed trading of variance swaps occur then? What do you consider to be high-speed?
would you be able to share your code/xls?
@Roland I think you answered your own question. I was trying to figure this out and thought it could be a difference between quoting a price and quoting deal amounts, but I assume this is a price quote not a deal?
Where does this question come from? Since you took a picture of the inequality - could you also please provide the reference to give the context?
by the initial price, if you mean the price when the bond is issues, then clean price =  dirty price. the difference is the interest accrued. so imagine that the last last coupon was paid out on 31st dec 2016. so at the end of march, interest component is about 1/2 of the semi-annual coupon. this component increases everyday as the person holding the bond has to be paid an interest. does this answer your question?
Are you able to request a quote from the counterparty you would be dealing with?
Can the book "Monte Carlo simulation in financial engineering" by Glasserman help you?
There is a class offered free to Interactive Brokers customers called Probability Lab https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5910 that purports to explain Options without using much math. I am not necessarily endorsing it but it might be of interest to you.
You ask about a 'call buying option trading strategy'.  The strategy would not just involve buying.  The strategy also involves the exit of the position.  You make no mention of that ergo you have no strategy.  What will happen if your position is up 9.9% but you are expecting 10%?  Does your strategy does not exit?  You need to consider this.  Your trade is not similar to a casino at all.  A casino game does not expire.  Yours does.  The casino stays open and takes bets continuously.  Yours does not.  The casino does not have Theta to deal with.  You do.
You should be able to make it all uniform in under 5 minutes by using very basic Excel.  You should definitely not omit anything but rather fill in missing fields with NULL or some other value until you find the missing data.  Side question: does your data come like this from the source?  If so, look for an alternative source.  This is terrible, IMO.
Can you share the dataset?
I was of course assuming continuous support over $[0,\infty[$, I indeed find it hard to claim that a stock price has a finite support (especially since the relationship you state holds $\forall T>0$). What is the question? Because there is no contradiction at all indeed. Two options that have the same prices $\iff$ their expected payout under the risk-neutral measure is the same. If the payout the former is bounded, while that of the latter is not, the equality can then only be explained by a difference in the weights => asymmetrical probability distribution (support/skewness/whatever)
Why not just find the stock returns and calculate it yourself?
How are the above formula derived? Can you please provide more details?
Would you mind tell us the expected option value and what the code gives you?

Why dt = T? This implies a time interval of 3 years. dt - should be possibly small

Have you read "Cooking with collateral" by Pieterbarg?
A conditional expectation of the form $Y_t = \Bbb{E} [ f(X_T) \vert \mathcal{F}_t ]$ (with no explicit dependence on $t$ inside $f$) will always be a martingale by the tower property, right? Just compute $\Bbb{E}[Y_t \vert \mathcal{F}_s ]$ to convince yourself that it is indeed equal to $Y_s$. Of course this is assuming the process is adapted to the filtration
@quantfin_enthusiast Consider the following thought experiment where a dividend-paying stock is expected to pay a *very large* dividend in exactly 6M. Two European options are written on that stock. They have exactly same strike but different expiries: $T_{\pm} = 6M \pm 1day$. Which one is the most expensive? Now suppose that instead these are American options, which one is the most expensive?
Without knowing what someone's intention was before the trade how could you know whether it was a quality fill or not and then rank it?  All parties have different reasons for trading and different levels of urgency associated with each trade.  In the absence of an arbitrage, there is no 'edge' on either side of the trade...unless you know what is about to happen next.  :)
Can you clarify what is in the SPV?  What type of assets?
Is the question why the SDE corresponding to **case 1** $$dS_t/S_t = (r-q)dt + \sigma dW_t,\,\,\, S(0)=S_0$$ provides the same solution for $S_T$ as   the SDE for **case 2**  $$dS_t/S_t = r dt + \sigma dW_t,\,\,\, S(0) = S_0 e^{-qT}$$ (note that they do not agree on the full dynamics of $(S_t)_{t \geq 0}$ but this is not important for European options, since they are not path dependent)?
I'd also consider contacting the authors directly - the paper is from 2013, I'm sure they'd be happy to clarify. (also didyou check the webside with datasets for the paper? http://www.econ.yale.edu/~af227/data_library.htm )
Weird, I have been quickly through both of the documents you have quoted but none of them refers to this (Black-Scholes) model. The only potential reference is on page 21 of the second document you quoted where it is written: *"historical lognormal returns rt"*. Could you be more explicit please?
Sounds like the 'covariance matrix' is not positive definite, i.e. not a covariance matrix. Where did cov_matrix come from?
It is unclear to me, what you mean by "apply steps 1) and 2) to daily (arithmetic) returns, and not to losses?". Losses are one side of the return distribution. Do you mean applying EVT to the other side of the distribution, the wins?
You mentionned "undiscounted call price". Are you sure that you indeed started from this?
You may need to provide more background information, for example, how is the Heston model defined? What are equation 2.5 and 2.6 etc., so that, for people without that book can understand your question.
What do you aim to achieve with the rolling window? What are you going to be putting the data into?
What are the consequences of choosing "too long" or "too short" a window size? What are the tradeoffs involved?
I do not think this approach is valid for this problem. The correlation between the brownian processses driving the values is not *high*, it is one, but the processes are just different. There is a deterministic relationship between the underlying and the values of the options. Even if you want to go down this route (which i strongly disagree with), consider this: you are assuming correlation is constant. What will the correlation be in the two scenarios where the stock price falls or increases? The correlation will tend to zero, and one, respectively. It's clear that you can't do it this way.
Sorry I do not understand your question, could you please give more about the context?
If the cost of liquidating the position is "the bid ask spread" then what is the cost of acquiring the position, zero? The entering and exiting cost must add up to the bid ask spread.
It is possible, but the explanation depends on what order type you use. Also, I assume, in reality it's 105.02 vs 105.03, i.e. price difference is 1cent, not 10cents?
Well, then that is how you should phrase the question: I need this functionality: ...(precise definition)... How do I do it on NASDAQ? 'Cause you wrote, that you've already sent an order, and it gets confusing
Can you set your utility functions to $U(x) =x$ and check that you get the exact same answer? An algorithm is not wrong just because an algorithm is doesn't do what you expect. This way we can rule out one possibility before getting started...
Can you change the penalty function to be $U(x) =1$, see if the algo then assigns the stocks evenly/randomly?
S&P futures trading ends at 16:15 Eastern time each day (and always has). So this should tell you what time zone is used in your data. When you do see trading stop for a little while?
The reasoning seems right. I did not have a deep look into the computations though. For instance, are you sure about your expression for $S_t^{(2)}$ ? Looks awkward to me although you indeed have a martingale. Same for your application of Girsanov (irrespective of the rest).
Do you truly know nothing about $S(t)$?
I think your best bet is to contact them: http://www.bseindia.com/products_and_services/product_pricing.aspx?expandable=0
I'm a little concerned about your regression specification, do you control for the fact that the individual fund coefficients are measured with error and possibly correlate with other fund coefficients before you take an average across funds?
Thanks, the setup sounded a little unfamiliar, but I don't do anything with mutual funds. Is the idea to make a statement like "on average funds do/do not earn alpha controlling for momentum"?
(...) see seminal paper 'Which free lunch would you like today sir?'. So under the strong assumption you could hedge perfectly, the best strategy would be to leverage that strategy with an infinite notional. What you could do in practice is estimate the real distribution of the delta-hedging P&L given market-frictions and discrete re-balancing to check whether this trade is indeed viable? I know it's not the approach you took, this is why this appears as a comment rather than an answer. Just my 2 cents.
What does the beginning day is 1.1 mean?
Are the time of death, the spending rate and the growth rate deterministic? If so it seems like a simple difference equation which can be solved backwards in time...
What strikes me here are the spikes in $\theta$ (and $v_0$): $\theta=0.2$ ($v_0=0.6$) means a stationary (initial) variance of 44% (77%) which looks huge! Since $(v_0,\theta,\kappa)$ are related through variance swaps' prices they here do seem to move hand in hand but it really seems like a numerical instability to me. Maybe a move from one local minimum to another? What optim algo are you using? Also do you compute smart initial guesses or use the guess of the previous day or? Note that Heston exhibits somehow 'redundant' parameters, it may be worth it to fix some of these (or constraints?).
From which book is your excerpt taken?
Starting with a value of $\gamma$, you can compute $w(\gamma)$ from the second equation and plug it into the RHS of the first equation and see what you get. If it does not match the desired $H$ you can try again with a different $\gamma$. This is what the article seems to suggest. Are you saying that this process does not work/fails to converge?
What is the $S$ in your equation? Note that you have $S_i$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$.
You do if your risk measure is coherent (see sub-additivity property). Anyway, if I follow correctly then your question boils to: how to transform a series of pairwise risk metrics into a single number, or rather, what are the pitfalls of doing it with a quadratic form? Further assuming that the pairwise risk matrix is symmetric I guess?

Out of curiousity do you have a source for the formula you use ? Doesnt it assume equal variance for both Sharpe ratios, maybe this would explain the difference (ie slightly different variance). By the way I am not even sure how you would compute/define the variance of the Sharpe Ratio...
I guess you forgot a $\min$ somewhere in your formula, as the way it is written now would allow the payoff to be negative (take the case where $S_T = 169/4$ for instance), while you said that "if $S_T < 169/2 = 84.4$, the holder receives nothing". I guess the correct formula would be something like: $$1000 - \max\left[ 0, 1000 \left( \min \left(\frac{169}{S_T} - 1, 1\right) \right)\right]$$ Am I right?
The question is then how to show that $\Delta B/B = (...)$?
Relative value ?
Did you mean to say "...that the delta of a European derivative is **constant** if and only if the payoff is linear..."?

First you buy the equity, then the firm issues debt to X, then you sell THE EQUITY (right? not the firm). X also has a claim on the firm, you are no longer the only claimant, value of your claim is the same as before
You need to define your terms and symbols, which are unconventional to say the least. What is $\|$? Is your $>=$ supposed to be $\ge$ or the right angle bracket followed by a $>$? What is $f[V_t;x]$? What is $E|Vt|$? Is that the same as $\mathbf E[V_t]$? On what filtration is the expectation taken on, at time $0$ or time $t$ or some other time? What is that specific probability measure $\varPhi$? Is it supposed to be the cumulative standard Gaussian distribution? What is $X$ the logarithmic moneyness?
This is a really sloppily and vaguely composed question. Do you really understand each symbol and what meaning it conveys, and what meaning you attempt to convey using it, when you write it down?
You said you did not know the LaTeX symbols for "conditioned" or "distributed". That implies that you do know what they SHOULD look like. Had you checked what you had written the first time, you would have seen all those weird symbols which differ from the looks you are familiar with and you would not have posted the question as it was. The fact that the question was posted as it was, implies that either you had not even read what you had written before posting it, or you really did not care about whether the question was readable or not. Do you agree?
What do you mean by "a Gaussian diffusion process"? Is $dS = \sigma S dB$ where $B$ is a standard Brownian motion such a process?
You logic is sound. I'm unsure why the description says "divided by square root of x'; but clearly your best option is to simply find out how the method is coded - why can't *you* see the code of the method?
Exactly what problem are you trying to solve? What does "capture" mean?

This is not very well composed.  I'm not sure what answer you expect given the multiplicity of questions you are asking. Furthermore, there are many superfluous comments and inaccuracies in your use of terms and notation that should be corrected. What is "Ito magic".  The GBM process as written has solution $S_\tau = S_0 e^{\mu - \sigma^2/2)\tau + \sigma W_\tau}$. Your reference to a Girsanov transformation is incorrect and unnecessary. Do you know what is meant by stochastic and path integral?  Do you know the distinction with an integral of the form $\int_t^T S_\tau \, d\tau$?
Hi Daneel. Not sure I follow everything. i) Why consider a non-traded asset? ii) I assume this asset does not generate capital distributions and that you could write - if it was traded + AOA - that: $V_F(t,t_0,T_i) = B(t,T_i) ( F(t,T_i) - F(t_0,T_i) )$ showing that $V_F(t_0,t_0,T_i) = 0$ for any $i$ ? To generate an exposure of effective maturity $T_S$ while entering a forward agreement at $T_1 > T_S$ how do you pick the weight $w_{t_0}^{(1)}$ ? By that I mean that as time passes and $T_1$ becomes smaller than $T_S$ you can then simply let $F_1$ expire and just enter $F_2$ with the same rule?
Yes that's what I understood but I'm not familliar with the way they implement such strategies. Okay, so basically you want your weights to be such that $w_t^1 T_1 + w_t^2 T_2 = T_S$ ? How do you do that at $t_0$ with only one future expiring at $T_1 > T_S$? Shouldn't you already start at $t_0$ with 2 futures $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$ such that $T_i < T_S < T_{i+1}$ ?
Isn't this the same as $P(B_2<4|B_1=1)$? .  Think of running paths backwards through the known point.
What is the name of this stupid thing? My *guess* is it is a "turbo warrant", i.e. a knockout call with the knockout level and the strike both equal to 145.50. Everything I know about turbo warrants is here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_warrant

Pls define the terms par yield and spot rate - are we talking only bonds here, or swaps also ?
Could you clarify your question a bit? What model do you want to price these payoffs under? Also, why insisting on simplifying the payoffs, do you want to find a closed form formulae for the pricing? If you just the price and if you're under Black-Scholes, you could use Monte Carlo, in this case, since you have a closed form formula for the call price, there is no need to simplify anything.
Have you looked through the API documentation?  https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/ It couldn't be more clear.  There are no special naming conventions.  I can pull any data with a normal symbol e.g. for SPY the symbol is SPY...what exactly is your problem with pulling data?
What is your question? If it is to "how to formulate a paragraph similar to the one you stated" then you simply make a sentence about your inputs, in this case 2-12-4-2 for different parameters (probably those most similar to Brown and Wong's) and you find the two nearest neighbours with a similar outcome and state them, i.e. "Brown and Wong".
I feel it could be some sort of average between "closed" FX Fwd quotes. Say we enter into an "open" FX Fwd with two exchange dates: at the 3M & 6M mark. Then in the absence of arbitrage the buyer should be projected to be indifferent to exchanging money at 3M or 6M (as seen from today), since the FX Fwd quotes represent exactly this equilibrium. Hence it should be 50-50 which date he chooses. So the closed quote is the average of the two. Thoughts?
Thinking about it more, you probably need a volatility term-structure model since each "open" date (on which the buyer is allowed to exchange money at the predetermined fx "strike rate") essentially represents an option. So american/bermudan pricing can probably be applied. Perhaps longstaff schwartz or binomial trees are applicable?
Hi ababoua, by steepner trade do you mean a CMS spread swap ? Or another payoff ?
what products do you want to market-make? Sure there are some general principles but most skills basically rely on knowing the specific nuances of the particular product very well.
do your initial weights satisfy the constraints? I have had problems with SLSQP before when the initial weights do not. Your inequality does not return a scalar, so I dont know if this will work. Try instead `bounds=  ((0,None),) * len(initial_weight)` rather than the inequality constraint.
Are you reinvesting dividends? Russell 2000 includes dividends but it is not total return index (meaning that compounding dividend payments by reinvesting are not included in the index price).   There is a separate Russell 2000 Total Return Index that includes reinvestment of dividends.  This could make a big difference over time unless I'm mistaken.
Why does the amount $A:=1/P(T,S)$ held at $S$ has the value $P(t,S)/P(T,S)$ at $t$?
It's hard to give you an answer to the question when you're asking several. Perhaps posting them separately will give you better feedback?
Have you considered using the Fama/French market factor as a reference? It‘s calculation is based on the (almost) entire US-stock universe and the S&P500 is just a certain (sub-)portfolio of US-stocks.
Hi there, could you point me to some elementary material on options & swap pricing, to better prepare for an interview like this?
Why do you need these? Note that $E\big(V(S_t) \mid \mathcal{F}_0\big) = e^{-r(T-t)}E\Big(E\big((S_T-K)^+\mid \mathcal{F}_t\big) \mid \mathcal{F}_0\Big) = e^{-r(T-t)}E\big((S_T-K)^+ \mid \mathcal{F}_0\big)$.
In words, this condition says that the risk-free outcome is somewhere in between the worst risky outcome and the best risky outcome... Makes sense no?
First, I presume you mean a continuously observed barrier option? And second, I would say that you can have path dependence without forward vol dependence if each of the observations are independent. That's not a required property, but just intuitively and only thinking for a few minutes it seems like it could be sufficient.
The main question is: why do you care about ROI ? Is the strategy designed to manage your own money or client’s money ? That makes a big difference when it comes to which metric are important.
What is wrong with taking the weighted sum of log returns accross the portfolio ? The main question here is *what* it is uou are trying to do with this. This will drive the assesment of whether a definition is pertinent or not.
why not simply define the portfolio log return as the linear combination of each asset log return ? What is wrong with that ?
Do you mean $S_{\tau}$ in your second equation?
Are you asking how to write an exchange simulator to back-test a strategy, or are you asking about the strategy itself?
A bond ETF is a physical investment of cash to purchase the fund, assuming you have cash to invest. A long position in a future requires no cash outlay (other than margin). What will the (rest of the) cash be doing in the case of buying futures then?
what is the "payoff" of an asset ? I don't understand your notation sorry.
Is your question on how to get limit order book data? If yes, then either you find a data provider that gives you limit order book snapshots at each point in time or that provides you with order book update instructions that you need to "replay" in order to recover the book state.
The file you linked has order book updates. So you *do* know how to construct the market depth at different times from those? If yes, then please clarify your question because I still don't understand it.
Is there a particular asset class that you're targeting?
1) How could it be for production and not trying to be as accurate as possible ? Sorry your use case is very unclear to me 2) spx options are european 3) same day option will have no issue with dividend since those have dropped by morning time 4)you need to price settlement correctly tho 5) other stuff (risk etc) but its unclear again what you want to
and what makes you think you need to be less accurate for risk when you are trading 1 day options ?
I fail to see in which circumstance it would be optimal to exercise intraday as opposed to end of day. Can you give an example ?
what you describe is a constraint from your margin, so that is suboptimal behavior with respect to the option contract itself and should not impact the optimal exercise policy. So i reiterate my question: when would it be optimal to exercise the option intraday as opposed to end of day ?
Not sure I understand you comment. You do know how to solve it when the payoff is $K \mathrm{1} \left\{ S_T < K \right\}$ and struggle with it being $K^2$?
So the $a_j$ terms are just constants? If yes, then just pull them out of the double integral?
Do you know that $E^Q(X/\Gamma)$ is $\Gamma$ measurable?
Regarding point 3, what distribution is this $p(x)$ fitting to?
You are fitting this t-distribution to something (a distribution of some sort). What is this target distribution you are fitting to?
You need to regress or fit the daily optimal (taking into account early exercise) payoff line which is computed backward. I do not understand why you need to fit the frequency distribution of daily returns. Also are you Monte Carlo simulating the stock price with a geometric Brownian motion or some other stochastic process?
Which paper and which result?
Im having a think about answering this, but what model did you use as your ML classifier?
Hi @ZRH, maybe it would help to have an example of the smile you are trying to fit. Could you provide $(K, \sigma(K))$ couples?
I think we should clarify some things first, to ensure that we do not mess up things. Futures as standardized forward contracts could be traded over an exchange at any time as long as you find a buyer. The future itself could be delivered (transferred) immediately or usually within 3 bank days. However this does not mean that the underlying is (physically) delivered. This is possible on expiry only (in contrast to options). Considering this, I do not see the arbitrage opportunity you mentioned. But maybe I missunderstood your question?
hmm.. What is te meaning of the word MM?
What is r_c? Why does it depend on T in your dS process?
Just to be clear: you want to find the dynamics of $F$? Hence $dF_t$
Do you have the training data for this?
Do you mean tight spread by one ticker market? bid-ask bounce is present there as well, so maybe worth explaining what you mean.
I believe, people usually call it tight spread (stocks or other instruments). Historically, academics studies didn't have the access to the limit order book and were tracking the price of the instrument using trade prices. These experience bid-ask bounce no matter what the spread is. More recently people started to use mid-price, which is much more stable. There is also a decent number of papers on the inventory risk. Perhaps, you can start here: https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/8897/academic-papers-about-market-making?noredirect=1&lq=1

Do you know Levy's characterization?
Where do you get that the prices are quoted in yield vols? I don't trade rate markets (Commods for me) but everything is generally quoted in price terms - if you give a "vol price" it has to make assumptions to get to the vol - what if your assumptions are different? I would be surprised if the market was quoted in vol terms - can you check?
It is confusing I'll admit. The $S_t$ in the first definition corresponds to $K$ in the second, $t$ to $T$, and the $S$ in the second is really just there because its used to give the price of $C$ which I imagine maybe gets expanded into the BS equation to write the local vol as a function of the BS surface? That would be my guess.
Hint:  What is the duration of floating rate bond?  Doesn't this look like the fixed leg or your swap?  Also, I don't think the fixed rate of your swap is changing every six months.  What is the duration of a fixed rate bond?  What is the duration of a combination or portfolio of bonds?
It is the riskneutral probability. What do you know about riskneutral valuation?
The model itself is known as Ornstein Uhlenbeck process in physics. Did you read Vasicek paper?

Is the underlying asset of the option a stock, futures on a currency pair, etc, or anything else about its life span like whether it can be exercised early (American vs European)? also which price are you looking for, call price or put price
Why not convert your handwriting to latex?
Why not make an appointment and talk with your prof? The handwriting is really not something people can easily understand.
It can be liquidity too. Are you using mid price (=(Bid+Ask)/2) of the option to calculate IV. What if the spreads are out of whack? In that case you will get a lot of noise in your curve.
Hello and welcome to SE. Could you add a minimal reproducible example to your question that anyone willing to help could run to get the same error you're getting? This will make it easier to help you :) Thanks
I believe the code and that the underlying model is Heston is irrelevant to your question, which is why European puts and calls have the same IV (in theory). Maybe you can edit your question and leave only the real question in the text?
Eurodollar futures prices are quoted as 100 minus the implied 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rate. A eurodollar futures price of USD 98.00 reflects an implied settlement interest rate of 2%. Could you include a numerical example to illustrate the issue you are facing?
What are the futures on? For futures on a stock, the same conditions should be there, commodity futures will weaken the argument, the degree its weakened by depending on the difficulty of physically holding the commodity between the dates in the calendar spread.
In the Black-Scholes model, there is an analytical formula for the price of an perpetual American options. You could differentiate that with respect to the stock price in order to get Delta and Gamma? Do you have a different model in mind?

You should be more precise about the strategy. Long/Short VIX gives rise to vol exposure or it's built in a way it does not? Or else? Otherwise asked this way a benchmark (i.e. a tradable systematic and representative portfolio) is L/S Vix.
Is your strategy long or short depending on its signal and vol neutral over time? or vol neutral with every trade?
Don't FX Forwards or NDFs represent all-in CCY depreciation?

Whether the letter "S" was actually included within, or if it was Mrs. Kent's idea, I'm not sure - the latter would lead to the question of why Mrs. Kent chose that letter.  Did she *know* he was destined to become known as "Superman", or was it meant to stand for something else?

You could just as well say "Is there more to Lavender Brown than her love for Ron (and for Divination)?" in HP. So she's not really the equivalent of Bella, far from it. She's just the equivalent of a minor character that isn't well defined.

What scar? Looking at the scene where Vader is unmasked to Luke, he has lots of visible burnt flesh scarring but no prominent scar like the vertical scar over his right eye from Episode III, however this also to was not visible in _Return Of The Jedi_ unmasking scene. For reference: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ayltc.png

Multiple continuities is going to be a problem here.  Do you mean in the mainstream comics continuity, in the Diniverse, in the movies?  Even just in comics, the New 52 continuity shift makes all of our assumptions pretty much meaningless.

I presume by "look the same" you are not referring to facial or body characteristics which are inherent to the assimilated individual or their species.  Aside from that, have you ever heard the phrase "Jack of all trades, master of none?".  That's pretty much what you'd end up with, if all Borg were the same.  So many features crammed into one body, that none of the features can be made to be particularly potent.  There is some advantage to having specialized individuals, and certainly the Borg understand that.  They also seem fairly modular though, so their specializations can be changed.
Not sure but it sort of reminded me of [this creature](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_afVNshJVx9Q/TA_aKZy3AEI/AAAAAAAAAlA/jSaNjbvzrBY/s1600/never_ending_story_remake.jpg) from my childhood that sort of "swam" through the air as well.  Maybe they are filled with Helium?
Data is intimately familiar with the *Enterprise* computer system; it seems reasonably to me that he would know exactly what he has to do to trick it into believing he's Picard. Maybe there's other stuff going on that we don't see? (Say, a denial-of-service attack on the internal sensors.) If you're thinking of the same original-series episode as I am ("A Taste of Armageddon"), the faker was a character-of-the-week who probably doesn't know anything about how starship security works...

You aren't thinking big enough. Think of Coruscant for example, obviously they need momentous amounts of trade to sustain their population with food and water. Additionally, blockades aren't just meant to "starve out" a population, they are there to prevent trade which in turn would cripple economies. Even if a world's farmers could produce enough food, what would they be paid with? Eventually the entire economy of the planet would shatter, *including agriculture*.

I'm talking about the fact that it makes a difference _which_ phoenix it was obtained from.

People dying too quickly does not mean they are very weak soldiers. I suppose they are elite, the best of the best (this is a small special force, remember? Even weak nations can field armies of hundreds of thousands, so there would be no shortage of average conscripts if they would choose so) Why do they still suffer enormous casualties? Well, they are fighting against genetically engineered aliens who have much better technology. I think it is a wonder they can kill at least **some** aliens especially at the beginning without reverse-engineered alien tech.

If so Kreacher wouldn't be alive, would he? Unless of course you consider that Dumbledore might have been too weak to get water or if he did he'd be too weak to fight off the inferi. But he had Harry there and there was enough time for him to recover enough to protect against the inferi. As vsz says the death would have been from something else namely a certain curse which Severus contained for a while. As for Kreacher he probably would have died (water, inferi) IF he HADN'T had the ability to return to his master (who had told him to return) and so in a sense the house elf magic DID save him.

I wondered about that as well.  Is this not also the first time one of the modern era Doctors has mentioned a specific family member?  He's always been vague in recent times regarding his family, aside from mentioning a couple times that he had one, but they were all gone now.
Pretty spoilery question title isn't it? >_>
Your question and title are asking two different things.  They may be related, but "How long did Isildur possess the One Ring?" and "How long did it take for the Black Speech to fade from the Ring?" are still two distinct questions with separate answers.
I don't think there's anything wrong with your question, but perhaps you could provide more information: where (as in, in what Star Wars work) is Terminus mentioned? What do you know about the planet other than its general location and name?

The question assumes an absolute frame of reference. If you end up on the opposite side of the sun because of Earth's orbit, the time machine works in relation to the sun. If you end up outside the solar system, it presumably works in relation to the galactic center. If you assume you'll be transported to a position relative to the galaxy or the sun, why not assume you're transported relative to Earth?

Oh, I started taking a quick look at these to see how difficult it would be to make a list if one didn't already exist, and 1x12 reminded me - there's a handful of primary arcs, which I believe are what you're referring to in the question, but there's other sub-arcs, such as the events of 1x12 coming up _much_ later in the series, that IIRC are in "monster-of-the-week" episodes.

`SkyNet shouldn't care about a timeline` - Sorry, but why do you think that?  Surely SkyNet would make a point to avoid doing things that would negate its existence, or change things.
I strongly object to the idea that Skynet wouldn't care.  You don't explain why you think that.  You just assume that it would be the case since the outcomes we witness in the story didn't have a huge impact on Skynet/Macines.  My guess is that it would care a huge amount and expend huge amounts of compute cycles trying make sure it traveled to a specific time that would improve the situation for the machines and have a the least amount of risk for making things worse.  Skynet is a computer after all, shouldn't we expect rationality?

@Trenin Did you really count? :) Well, I don't know, never really thought about it. When I do, it seems that as you say important characters tend to have them more often (which makes sense), and that many of the Night's watch men have them (Dolorous Edd, Halfhand, Old Bear, Toad, Small Paul, Stonesnake, etc).

I did a quick search and couldn't find any precedence for this. Perhaps a meta discussion on it before we close?
Are you addressing the good old "sounds in space" problem? I guess the scientific consultants were quite aware, that this sound cannot happen. How could they try to explain it?
What would be the value of this?  Remember Lily's protection wasn't a general purpose shield against everyone.  It was primarily focused on protected Harry from Voldemort.  The enhancements via Dumbledore, made it a bit more general purpose when Harry was at his aunt's house.  Who do you imagine that Voldemort would have needed that kind of protection from?  Would Voldemort even have allowed it?  Whenever he dueled Harry, he mostly ordered his followers to not interfere.
On that page, it says in the background information that Alexander Siddig (Bashir's actor) didn't know until that episode.  So I suppose you're asking about anything other than what the character did?
Also, how do you strangle a being that doesn't breathe (cf First Contact) and probably also doesn't need blood circulation to the brain in the human sense?
Was it any good? It sounds like quite good fun, debating buying it.
Was there a main character? If so who? Which class was he/she in? If not, what was the POV of the story?
“Destroyed by nostalgia!” How does that work?
Do you remember when you read it?
First, what date are we talking? 001M41 would be vastly different than 999M41. Second, I don't think GW would give exact numbers on the controlled systems. Stuff like that tends to limit their ability to make up new stories.
Why do you think it is broken or disabled?  Taboo is a locater spell.  It doesn't need to be disabled during the Battle of Hogwarts.  The death eaters were attacking already, what would they do if when someone said Voldemort?  Realize the enemy was in the castle they were attacking?  After Harry was captured, what were they going to do when he said the name again?  Harry was supposed to be held in relative safety until Voldemort arrived.
You mean more special than being the only wand in the window? IIRC Olivander's shop was rather unimpressive through and through. But when you've got a local monopoly on wands, I guess it doesn't matter much what your store looks like, since everyone will have to come to you anyway.

Are you looking for exact numbers, or a comparison of the strength of each army?
Stupid question here... what the heck is a stinger?
I'm more wondering how no one else found out where it is located. Are Parseltongues really that rare? Even if they aren't, people like Dumbledore can apparently teach themselves Parseltongue, and Ron opens the Chamber without even understanding what he himself is saying. Not to mention, the Chamber is freaking huge, how did no one figure out there was a big freaking room no one explored before?
Maybe he invented the replacement of competition with cooperation? *gasp*
Er..  Wasn't this question _just_ asked this morning or yesterday?  I know I didn't see this one, as I was at work...
So many of these details match "Branestawm's Disappearing Abolisher" (one of Norman Hunter's Professor Branestawm stories); are you sure that it was the professor faking an electricity leak in order to turn the device on the inventor, as opposed to the professor (who invented the device) and a colonel demonstrating the device to a classroom full of students and one of the students turning the device on the professor while the colonel was out of the room?
Hmmm...was it a stand alone story? Or part of the literature for the game? If the latter, this might be a better fit on RPG.SE.

Is it clear in the first Captain America film that they *need* to use goggles, or is it just fear/reverence for the Cube? e.g. the caretaker “It is not for the eyes of ordinary men”.
Your question reminds me of [this](http://youtu.be/AxsjRmN9syc?t=3m) video (starts at 3:00). The whole video is amusing, but the very end makes it clear you're not the only person to wonder about this.
If it's true that... Where'd you hear that? Do you have a source?
As to the "Why does it work instantly?": I guess to avoid repetitions and "boring" learning time. Look at *Stargate SG1*. The first few episodes started with language barriers, but they dropped those pretty fast. The only scifi-series I know that got language barriers right (and not boring) is *Babylon 5*: The viewers understand spoken language on a point-of-view basis, i.e. if you follow character x, who doesn't understand, the viewers don't either (actually similar to the companions in *Doctor Who*).
Isn't it pretty well-proved that Jon did not know, from his reaction when it is revealed?
I assumed that Jon meant it as a slight, he thinks Rattleshirt received mercy he did not deserve. Something that was more odd was that Stannis said to Jon `You haggle like a crone with a codfish, Lord Snow. Did Ned Stark father you on some fishwife?` when we are told in a Davos chapter that supposedly Ned Stark left some fisherman's daughter with "a bag of silver and a bastard in her belly".
can you be more specific what out of sync things you've seen in the film?  I've seen it a couple times but I didn't pick up on any of that.  Let me know and I'll try to go back and watch it again.
You're asking "when?" when talking about a time travelling guy who tends to lie a bit, confuse things a bit, and who often doesn't really know where he ends up at (or at least not where he expected to be)? ;) In other words: Are you looking for a chronologically first date according to the Doctor's timeline or earth timeline?
@Jim For future reference, where did you look?  We don't know what those "several places online" are.
Is "the Luke" some new band on Tatooine?
For consideration regarding the "magnets" theory: Disney recently released [13 fun facts about Age of Ultron](http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/JoshWildingNewsAndReviews/news/?a=117165) - including the fact that magnets have now been added to the shield. To say that they have been added now implies that there were no magnets in use before. (To be fair, this says they were added to his gauntlet, not his back.)
Can you becaem Secret Keeper by yourself? I thought it must always be another person you trust. Trust is alien to Voldemort, so...
Remember that scene when the emperor electrocuted the hell out of Vader, similar to how he did to the Jedi in Episode 3? Do you think maybe he's afraid of that happening to him?
Does the original source say that one would be sufficient? IIRC Yavanna wanted all three.  And if light is what she needed, why not just use the light the Silmarils emitted??
Was anyone actually *aware* of Dumbledore's death at that point?  I get the feeling that it was kept secret for a little while...and also, who says Dumbledore, in trusting Snape, didn't give him the password to his office before departing so that Snape could access it?

But they clearly weren't there, even pre-M-Day. Says who? X-Men, for all its ethnic and demographic diversity, was an American comic book primarily set in America. Just because the lives of Asian and Indian mutants are seldom addressed, it doesn't mean they aren't there: they just don't impact the story. You might as well ask where all the South American wizards are in Harry Potter.
I thought all those *are* canon instances. Didn't Howard the Duck cross-over from Duckworld and has been stuck on 616 ever since?

Isn’t *being disappointed* an emotion? Seems that Spock's father doesn’t control his emotions, so he should be disappointed about himself.
Well... why not?
I personally know of nothing in canon that indicates that becoming a Secret Keeper "imprints the information on your soul." Can you please indicate where in the books this is stated? Check out chapter 10, *The Marauders Map*, in PoA for a canon explanation of the Fidelius Charm. Voldemort did not feel the death of his Horcruxes; per Dumbledore, Voldemort's soul was so fractured by that point that he was incapable of feeling it. Seeing as the whole "soul" thing is not in the books, I would say, No, the Secret Keeper doesn't feel it. Canonically, they may or may not know they've become the SK.
@BMWurm My point is, that it doesn't matter. River Song and the Doctor agree that they are happily married, and that is that. Is the happiness of two people not enough for you?

I wonder if something created _by_ the room can be taken _out_ of the room.  I don't believe we saw this happen in the books.  In fact, if I recall correctly, the only thing that actually came _out_ of the room (besides people) was the diadem, which wasn't originally created by the room (and anyway it immediately disintegrated - perhaps that wasn't due to fiendfyre after all?)
I felt that my answer to this one was about as good as it gets. Is there anything else you'd like me to add before considering an acceptance?

JKR has also told us that witches and wizards have longer life spans than Muggles, so there must be some genetic component in wizards that has to do with longevity. Factually inaccurate: the fact that wizards and witches live in a different society means they have different exposures to health hazards and resources. Perhaps they live longer because of magical cures? Perhaps they don't breath, drink and eat all the toxic residue from our industrialized society as much as we do? And perhaps it is genetic. The point is: population health differences do not necessarily mean genetic differences.

Self-aware or no, *does* the Jedi Code say anything about no killing? In CW and before, they *had* been in wars against living sentients, not just against Sith and droids, and in their capacity as the Senate's peacekeepers they surely sometimes had to kill too. One version of Code goes  'Jedi respect all life' but respect does not preclude ending it with cause (no source puts them as vegetarians, to my knowledge). Buteven self-aware droids'd be non-living and have no force flowing through them which might make them 'easier' for Jedi to face. (Easier for audiences to root against too)
Diggle does have a source of income through Layla's work with ARGUS, presumable Roy still works as a bar back for whomever owns the Foundry now (I'm guessing it's still open at night?) Perhaps he's gone full "Robin Hood" and takes whatever currency he can off the crooks he busts.

I always envisioned him truly getting shot and then pulling the same trick that Nick Fury did in Cap2: getting the doctors to declare him dead, making the most of an unexpected opportunity. The idea could have formed when he woke up (or was resuscitated) in the hospital, more of a "just don't tell anyone I woke up" sort of thing. In that case, there wouldn't have been a long-term plan, he would have just been biding his time, calling in favors with people he could trust, and waiting for an opportunity to turn the tables on the Joker. No proof, but its how I read it.

The vampire mythology is not science-fiction, so it's pointless to try to slap a scientific explanation over one of its components.

As to Bram Stroker's Dracula, there is nothing special about sunlight; only that he loses many of his magicial powers during the day, weither or not that there are clouds, making him therefore a much easier target to kill. It's only later that the burning by direct sunlight (either fatal or not) has been introduced in the mythology.

They really aren't that important in the grand scheme of things, they're like drops of water in the ocean. Hell, after Thorin died things still went pretty smoothly. I'm sure the reasoning was more of "this will be interesting" than anything else.
Are you talking about the novels or the books which come with the campaign books?

Unfortunately, *First Contact*, *Insurrection*, and *Nemesis* all feature contrived ways of getting Worf back on the Enterprise.  It was fine to do it once in *First Contact*.  In *Insurrection*, they couldn't even take it seriously in the film.  When Worf is about to explain why he was "passing through", Picard basically cuts him off and says he doesn't care.  Why would Worf be passing through anywhere without the Defiant at the height of the Dominion War?
What? I'll never have a cloud to fly around on? Aw... But answering your initial question: Probably not, because he wouldn't be able to recover then. You definitely can hurt your back without permanent damage though.
Are you sure you watched the movies? This is spelled out pretty well over the course of all of them.

I'm speculating, but maybe Dumbledore only found out about Sirius being the secret keeper later? He might not have been that close to the Potter's to know that Sirius was supposed to be their secret keeper.
Earth is 70% covered in water.  Most of time when you fly, it's going to be over oceans.  Then there's the fact that, even if he's effectively invincible, it sill _hurts_... most people don't survive plane crashes, after all.  Maybe the impact from a crash would be enough to knock one of his bones out of position?  Or perhaps he actually did have to make a non-voluntary, un-assisted fall from an airplane... and of course survived.
So... you're on a battle field where armies just keep showing up, and you want to commit them all based on a circumstance that is obviously not stable?  I strongly dispute the idea that 'there is seriously no reason to leave them'... at best there is no current reason in a situation that is likely to change.
Doesn't the special edition that has been around lately and also shown on tv have all the outtakes in it?
Isn't celibacy and not taking wives or fathering children the same? By the way, the vows are pretty much similar -if not identical- in the show to the books' version.
The Doctor is connected to the TARDIS in a number of mysterious ways, and it seems to "regenerate" along with him at times.  Just my own personal assumption when I was watching the show, but could it be that his regeneration isn't actually destructive to his environment, but that the TARDIS specifically is effected by it?  After all, multiple regenerations have happened in close proximity to humans, who remained completely unharmed.
Have you read A Feast For Crows and beyond? They explain why *at this particular point in time*, the Seven is relatively peaceful, and alludes to points in time where the situation is different.
So you don't remember how Ser Beric Dondarrion died ? How he gave up his regenerating powers to revive Catelyn that was washed up by the river, because he felt guilty letting Arya slip away ?
After when? After what point are you asking about?

Why do we assume that sound would be the only thing to awaken a dragon?  Smaug could smell him.  Couldn't a case be made that Bilbo's scent woke the dragon?
I always assumed it was because the ring didn't want to be _found out_ as the One Ring. Once it's in the fire, [that super secret message](http://topinfopost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/the-words-coca-cola-supposedly-engraved-in-the-one-ring-to-rule-them-all.jpg) becomes clear on the band. Maybe the ring didn't want anyone to know it was the One Ring, bar Sauron. But for this to be true, the ring would need some form of sentience, or maybe a spell which stops people from throwing it into fires? It actually sounds pretty stupid to me now tbh...

Could it be possible that the Enterprise crew weren't shocked at seeing a Romulan for the first time, but more at the fact that a Romulan was attacking them?  After all when Pike and Nero are talking a few scenes later, Pike tell Nero that the Romulan home world still exists, that it's 'still out there' and that Nero didn't see what he claims to have seen.  So, I don't think they were seeing a Romulan for the first time but they were more along the lines of surprised that a Romulan was attacking them unprovoked.
@Praxis What?  Pike didn't meet Nero until they went to save Vulcan, the Enterprise's maiden voyage.  Nero told Pike to travel to his ship to discuss negotiations, at which time Pike was abducted.  What's this 20 years later nonsense?
@Praxis Not a problem, I kinda figured there was a misunderstanding.  But again, wouldn't the Federation already know about the Romulans and what they look like?  Also, I don't think there's ever a mention of who or what destroyed the Kelvin and Nero didn't reveal himself officially until the attack on Vulcan.  So again, I don't think that the Enterprise crew was reacting to seeing a Romulan for the first time or learning that Nero was a Romulan because no one knew who Nero was at that point.  I think they were reacting to the fact that a Romulan was attacking unprovoked.

I think it is a valid question, e.g. "Doesn't Hodor have free will?", but put it a much too inflammatory way. There is no mention anywhere that Hodor gets substandard food, that he does not get time to rest,  that he is never thanked, or that his efforts are not recognized. Rather the opposite, I would say. Everyone is always nice to Hodor, and he helps out because he is a "friendly giant". Calling Bran dark when he does not have a malignant bone in his body is rather far fetched.

Also, LoTR-related games are generally not canon.
I agree Fruggiero.  The UFP economy still needs *currency*.  That currency need not be based upon material possessions as ours is.  Instead it would be more likely labor, services, or chore based.

Not all of this work can be performed by robots and replicators won't provide high quality care for your ailing grandparents.  If people only work for personal satisfaction, why would anyone volunteer to perform the UFP equivalent of pumping septic tanks?

From the first time I saw this, I thought it odd that in the middle of a fight, he trades any advantage of readiness for a meditation pose. And for what? A clear mind & centered state of calm? There must be something else he's doing... There are no other obvious Force effects. I argue that when Jedi meditate, they are active in the Force. Do you recall Luke handstanding and floating rocks in TESB? Same thing: body still, huge Force activity.

I guess we go by publication date, because that's more verifiable, and anyway the idea is "introduced" when it's published. Anyway, I think *Skylark* is too late even if we go by the 1918-1919 date.

Sorry for making a second separate comment, but your question reminds me very much of a bit in the film version of *Goblet of Fire*. In it, Dumbledore is addressing the students in the Great Hall, and suddenly Filch bursts in, runs to the front of the hall to Dumbledore, and whispers in Dumbledore's ear for several seconds. Then he runs out the same way he came in, and Dumbledore simply resumes addressing the students. What the heck did Filch say? We can't hear it and it's never explicitly explained. That little sccene has always seemed jarring to me, and unnecessary. :)
I've never watched the series, but I'm planning to. Can you tell me, without giving too much away, whether there were lots of unresolved storylines when the Disney pulled the plug on the show?

I think you could narrow this question down significantly by just asking *How did Draco know Sirius was Harry's Godfather*?

Just my $0.02 (and please don't take my comments as me trying to be unkind -- I'm totally known for wall o'text posts myself :)
You could also ask *Did Draco know that Sirius was Harry's Godfather* in a separate question. I only make the points in my comment above because when posing questions here, we want other users to answer and debate them (the person asking a question is welcome to join in the discussion, of course). If we answer them ourselves -- or give a full list of all caveats -- in the body of the question, where's the inspiration for discussion and answers from within the community? I've really liked your thoughts on HP, so I just wanted to offer a couple of suggestions :)

Do we know he's unprotected there? After all, there was someone on Privet Drive to keep an eye, and it seems at least plausible that Dumbledore/the Order stays quietly vigilant during these transition periods.
Lilly's protection is in Harry's blood.  Perhaps the protection offered by being at home extends to Petunia's blood?  (Probably not all the Dursleys, though, as Harry was attacked by Dementors in the presence of Dudley.  Then again, it could be that home offered protection against Death Eaters serving their master, but not Dementors serving their vile hunger.)
Who placed the protection is not in debate.  It's a question of mechanics. What, exactly, did Dumbledore's protection do? It's assumed that he placed the charm upon the house, but I haven't seen any canon evidence that expressly rejects the idea that he placed the charm upon the *family* instead. The "bond of blood" seems to suggest the latter more than the former. Usually it doesn't matter, as home and family are in the same location.  But when the Dursleys are travelling, does the charm stay on the house or go with them? Why did no death eaters ever abduct Vernon from Grunnings, for example?
Even if you're only looking for material (books, games, etc.?) there's a lot of that in 3000 "years" of events in the *Star Wars* universe. Also, if you have multiple questions they should be split up rather than posted all in one question.

Eru isn't going to get involved, Eru almost *never* interacts with the world.  There's no way Eru is an option.  As for the others, do we have any reason to think they wouldn't be tempted by the Ring?  Maiar can clearly be corrupted by it, so maybe Valar would be immune, but maybe not.  And even if they were immune, would the messengers who brought it be tempted by it, or the people tasked with guarding it?  The Ring's preservative effects would be especially tempting for the Elves...  Plus, as long as the Ring survives, Sauron survives, so destroying it is better than safely hiding it away.
This made me think of another good question, but I'll post it as a separate one. How the heck did he know WHAT to do?

A speculative question for consideration: would you expect your enemy to use a Palantir, the primary and most effective means of communication with your greatest enemy, to just **throw it out the window as a blunt object to club you with**? I sure as heck wouldn't. The fact Wormtongue did this suggests that it is an object of less importance than it actually was. Also food for thought: why didn't he recognize the One Ring right away? ;)
Have you ever tried to look at the sun?  Maybe they just appeared to go behind the sun because he could not actually see the tower while it was transversing the sun?
Really? I didn't find the movie version of Faramir to be whiny or beaten. He seemed exactly as he should, a good man who couldn't win his father's respect despite being a good man. His treatment of Frodo was a little out of character, but realistically any military man would at least think about putting the needs of his country first.
Are House Elves actually bound to a House? I don't recall Harry ever commanding Kreacher to stay in Grimmauld Place, so why would he be unable to leave?
Yeah, but they were bound by things other than the house weren't they? Dobby was betraying his master (as much as he could bring himself to) and was punishing himself for that (whenever he's close to revealing secrets he starts to hurt himself more, which doesn't make any sense if he was just punishing himself for leaving the Manor). Kreacher was specifically forbidden to leave Grimmauld Place as it was the Order headquarters and he wasn't trusted to keep their secrets. Note - I don't think many elves WOULD leave a house without orders, but I don't think anything is stopping them.
As for this particular example: trying to trick the Sorting Hat is a very scheming thing to do. How sure is this Ravenclaw that he won’t be resorted into Slytherin? And what will he do when the real Logan shows up, with no memory of the Sorting Ceremony, but who claims to have been knocked out by another student?
As for the last part regarding Seven, I think she was posing as a computer/programming specialist, which would indeed put her in Sciences blue. But it's definitely blue in that episode, so you might be slightly color-blind... or you might need to adjust the color on your TV. My son is color-blind, and when he looks at plain ol' green camo patterns he sees blue. Maybe you're the opposite?
If this Terminator "diplomat" came to me with that proposal (really a threat), I would be all the more determined to unplug Skynet. A machine threatening nuclear war for any reason must be destroyed, because what's to stop it from making the same threat for some other reason?
Why is there research into AI going on in the real world?  Skynet's self-awareness might be fantastic by the standards of our current achievements, but the pursuit of Skynet itself is not.
Let's say Skynet is programmed to not allow Americans to come to harm. Even with the best intel, it's impossible to know if there will be collateral or unintended damage, possibly resulting in the harm of Americans. Skynet wants to bomb a South Korean embassy - but it must know whether or not Americans will also be in it, or too close. And should it factor the repercussions of such actions? South Korea would retaliate. Skynet's actions would specifically lead to the harm of Americans.

Best swordsman of westeros? I don't think so, all the members of the kingsguard outskill him easily, including Jaime Lannister. But he wasn't arrested for those reasons, Ned was a fool for being honorable and confronting Cersei instead of taking actions immediatly when he found out about the bloodline, she acted quicker that's all. Another reason behind the rebellion of the north is that the north was one of the last kingdoms to bend the knee to the Targaryen king. Till then, they had their own king, the king in the north, killing Ned just made them want to reinstate the king in the north.

Why do you assume Bellatrix is so powerful? All this passage says is she was "equal" to a 17-year-old and two 16-year-old wizards, none of whom had much experience dueling death-eaters (DA is no substituted for actual battle). Molly, on the other hand, was nearly as old as the three of them combined, and a great deal more experienced, not just from general growing older, but more importantly having been a member of the original Order of the Phoenix, fighting in and surviving the first war.

Do you remember if the two groups fight?
@Null - Surely the answer to that would be simple, wouldn’t it? It could be about the lesser of two evils. During the second World Wars, the US engaged in the internment of Japanese-Americans, the displacement of hundreds or thousands of native Alaskans, and the killing of hundreds of thousands of uninvolved civilians (and millions of enemy soldiers - let us not pretend that their lives were worthless), among other atrocities, but the prospect of Hitler or Imperial Japan taking over was certainly far worse. Since the films draw heavily from WWII, perhaps this is what Lucas had in mind.
Oh, dear. Is this his real handwriting?!
Didn't Neelix get his lungs back that way?
I can't comment on the council seat, but as far as the embassy, I would say this: You seem to be tacitly saying that the impact a species had must be positive and therefore an embassy is given as a reward. But that doesn't have to be the case. Fighting a war would most definitely have an impact, albeit a negative one. Maybe the embassy was a means to prevent further misunderstandings?
I'm also wondering why it is called "UFO 54-40". How many UFOs were there?!

When I read the book, I sensed the reluctance in Aragorn.  Isildur and Isildur's bane are a dark and terrifying part of his heritage.  The return from defeat of the Sauron is due to Isildur - his failure of character to destroy the ring.  How many people die because of that?  It has to be like being a genetic offspring of Benedict Arnold.

i havent seen this episode in a while, when they dig data's head up do they already have a current data? Also were dealing with a 10 year time gap, here also the enterprise E is the top of the line for federation tech at the time. personally it may not even be standard to search for positronic signatures, but data and jordi regularly add "new" things to old scans. Data was always personally looking for others like him.
It's been a while since I watched those *DS9* episodes, but was that during the time that Bashir *himself* was a changeling?  (That could be one reason why Bashir didn't try harder to detect the changeling.)  Also, other changelings might be better at tolerating and pretending to eat solid food than Odo.
Does the weight of the Hulk increase as well? I imagine the Hulk must weigh several tons in order to pull off stunts like lifting cars!

Is there really a Sith "Order" anymore, or is this like Phil Miller establishing himself as "President of the United States" in *The Last Man on Earth*? There's no one to oppose it, so why not call himself "Dark Lord of the Sith"?

You edited this question, bumping it up to the top of the front page, just to add a note which you admit is unrelated?! -1 for that.
Perhaps honor can't be restored by being adopted into a new house, but if everyone thinks he is part of the bloodline of the new house, he will have his honor back--and as an honorable Klingon he wouldn't be willing to consciously lie about his bloodline, making the memory change necessary?
Hmm, is your question not about why they would need to do this to restore his honor in the eyes of Klingon society, but just about whether the Klingon belief system says his soul would still be dishonored even if no one except Worf, not even Kurn himself, knew about it? If so, perhaps we can infer from this episode that Worf wasn't really a true believer.
Why would you need to remember your name and species, if you're alone for centuries?  It's like remembering your own phone number: why, when you never call yourself?  Likewise, I don't think of myself as being my name; that's just a label other people have fixed on me, so when I'm alone it's irrelevant.
@Null Doesn't the Oracle say that "aliens, vampires, and werewolves" are programs that are "doing things they aren't supposed to be doing"?  I always thought those were programs that, whether by choice (e.g. Oracle) or malfunction (e.g. Smith), were operating outside of their design.  It's unlikely that a faulty program would be faulty from Day 1, which means they probably *became* faulty sometime during their life cycle.
@JMFB And what critique of Enterprise do you have which distinguishes your list from mine? I wasn't listing what I find bad per se (that is a longer list which doesn't include everything I mentioned), but what simply doesn't fit. The Larry Niven episodes of TAS, amongst others, don't fit. Final Frontier and Generations don't fit. There are aspects of the Abramsverse which I enjoy, but on the whole, it really doesn't fit.
@Howard8614 Are you asking just about comic books or are you including the movies and other sources as well?
How would that work anyway? _"Sol is only 30,000 light years from the galactic rim"_ be that as it may, but the next closest "thing" which isn't really interesting is another 30kly away whereas the next "thing" that indeed _might be_ interesting (but is no galaxy) is about 160kly away. The next closest galaxy is 2.5Mly away. That's 2,500 years of travel given one of the fastest ships available by 2371.
Related to a comment I left on an answer, when you ask if Starfleet has ever purposefully sent a ship outside the galaxy, are you referring specifically to Starfleet Command or some other central authority within the Starfleet/Federation structure? Or simply anyone in Starfleet that is capable of giving orders? Technically, even an Ensign can "order" a ship to go some place.
But the last episode showed you that the Jaqen H'ghar from S5 isn't necessarily the same as the one in S1. I mean: you see him drinking poison and dying, and then the girl is suddenly Jaqen H'ghar. "Jaqen H'ghar" doesn't exist, it's simply a persona used by one of the Faceless Men, who are "no one". Of course there was no plan to recruit Arya: just look at the impossible chain of events, including the rolling prison catching fire and Arya saving them. How would you plan such a thing?

@Omegacron maybe, and maybe he'll turn out to be the valonqar, after all, the description fit him very very well. Also, the fact that Varys knows about him, gives Varys another dimension, that of an elusive man, even at the service of the targaryens, i mean why didn't he tell Daenerys about him ?
Is there any indication that he was considered a member of the Senior Staff prior to the Gateway incident? It was my understanding that he was simply a bridge officer at the time, and Janeway kept him in that spot due to his performance.
I felt that my answer was pretty comprehensive. Is there anything else you think should be addressed before considering an acceptance?
@Praxis How would you know that information had just magically appeared in your mind as opposed to a normal thought.

I reckon these answers referring to books written in the 1980's are missing the mark. The Internet wasn't just easy to imagine from advances that were already well underway, the Internet actually already existed. What was the first work on science fiction prescient enough to predict an interconnected network of computing devices at a time when neither existed? Honestly; we had telephone and fax by the 1870's. The U.S. Navy used a form of wireless Ethernet (CSMA/CD) for communications during WWII and we had honest to goodness digital computers by the mid 1940's.

I don't know of any evidence that Ridley Scott or any of the Alien script writers were inspired by this particular organism though.

No source is given for that particular info, but the Grey Knight novel and (surprise!) the Grey Knight Codex are sources in the same section

Where does the figure of 296000 km/s come from? Is it stated in the book or did you deduce it from other things? Also, when you say the journey took over 40 years, is that from the perspective of people on Earth or people on the ship? And is it specifically said that this time is because the journey there and back took over 40 years, as opposed to a shorter journey but with a long stay on Alpha Centauri before returning?
Hmm, so time dilation couldn't solve the problem anyway, since in reality time dilation would always cause people who make a round trip to and from an approximately inertial location like Earth to experience *less* time than what was experienced on Earth, not more. Is it possible that 296000 was some kind of maximum speed, rather than the speed the ship was traveling for most of the journey? Could you provide the specific quote where that figure was mentioned so we can see how ambiguous or unambiguous it is?

I don't think it is sufficient for an answer but all known animangus forms coincide with the user's patronus if both are known.  Dumbledore and Tonks have both had magical creatures as patronus's (patroni?).  Ergo if you can't have a magical creature animangus form, either a person with a magical creature as a patronus cannot become an animangus and/or an animangus form can differ from the user's patronus.  I do learn more towards the latter being true as Tonk's patronus does change and animangus feels immutible.
There are a few times that aliens use their own languages and it isn't translated. I wonder if it's just meant to be for the audience or if somehow the translator knows not to do it... or what?

So a good answer would cite some evidence of Moffat's intent, like a statement he made, and not in-universe speculation?
Isn't this off topic?   Wouldn't it be better to ask if it was based on a similar book (with a different time period)
What kind of relationship are you looking for? Are you wanting episodes where events affect the plot of the movies or just episodes that are affected by or reference something that happened in the movies? There are tons of the latter but virtually none of the former.

A couple of things. First, expulsion would not necessarily mean he would leave Hogwarts. Hagrid proves that. Second, I'm not sure on the timing, but did Snape always understand that Harry had to he the one who killed Voldemort? The expulsion attempts could have been before Dumbledore told him that. Most of the expulsion threats seem to come in earlier books from what I remember. I could be wrong about that though.
Wait.... you understood part of the plot of that movie? I didn't even realize there was a plot.
Planned process by known actors is much clearer than anything in your question. Still, what do you mean by 'known'? Known to who? The person being summoned? The reader? The author? God?

Why couldn't it be a trap which Lester invented? I don't have the time to search through the entire publication history of Superman to prove a negative, but indications are strong that the cello-shield hasn't appeared in any other medium prior to the movie. The idea of it being a trap in the fortress reeks of hand waving, but even accepting that, the credit/blame still goes to Lester.

Why do you think that seeing yourself means there aren't multiple timelines? The way multiple timelines often work in fiction is that if you start in timeline A and jump back in time to some date, you end up in a timeline B that was identical to timeline A right up until that date, and then diverged with your arrival. So if I travel to 12 noon on some date, then at 3 pm I decide to jump back to 1 pm, I will end up in a timeline identical to the one I just came from up until 1 pm--and that would include the fact that I had appeared at 12 pm and was still around at 1.

She didnt give him a crossbow or a spear or some different thing that he couldnt use proficiently. She gave him a bow. You call Legolas an expert archer. Well... An expert would very quickly get a feel for the new weapon. That is why he is called an expert and not a novice.
If you tried building such a Wizard-Muggle-Food-Chain operation, do you honestly think the Ministry would let you get through with that? Consider the fact how huge the Ministry is, compared to the comparatively marginal wizarding population.

Noone can be that inefficient, not even government officials, that a wizarding population of a few thousand need more than a few dozen people governing them. Since there are hundreds and hundreds working there, they look out for things like your plan.

*Quest for Magik* is my very favorite comic arc but Sooraya is more of a supporting character at that point. What's your threshold for "significant appearance?" For example, in *Magik* she has a couple 2-character scenes but is not the focus of the plot.
Yes, I'm still hoping to tackle this when I'm home and have access to my comics, but the 3-page/2-scene stipulation feels a bit arbitrary and a little daunting. To clarify - is that the rule issue to issue, or in each trade compilation listed? As an introduction to comics, hopping from issue to issue might put your wife off of the comics as Dust is rarely central to the A plot and so the whole endeavor may end up more confusing than inviting.
Given the way BB-8 works, wouldn't painting her "gum up the works", i.e. render her immobile?
George Lucas apparently gave Carrie this explanation:  "He has seen [Wishful Drinking] a couple of times and explained the thing about him saying there was no underwear in space. He explained that in space you get weightless so your flesh expands but your bra doesn’t: “So you get STRANGLED by your bra!” So that’s why I couldn’t wear a bra in the first Star Wars. He came backstage when I did the show in San Francisco and told me that. I said, ‘Really? Now I understand everything."
@dunraven - I find the notion ridiculous myself... but then I found this article: http://www.space.com/20730-human-body-spaceflight-weird-facts.html and I can't help but wonder if Lucas was referring to something like that and specifically, about potentially getting taller/changing size.  Strangled, though?  Seriously?

Hogwarts is technically a castle/keep/fortified building. Can you imagine a castle without a cannon? Especially in Great Britain where "my house is my castle"? There is such thing as tradition after all... shees...
It's a running joke in the films, that the contestants will begin on the sound of the cannon, and Filch repeatedly sets the cannon off too early, at least twice while Dumbledore is still talking. I don't think it's in the books either. However, in the Muggle world, cannons are used for ceremonial purposes, too, the salutes for example. Possibly it had had a similar function at Hogwarts and evolved out of an acquaintance with the Muggle world?

Secrets, lies, obfuscation; these are the things that lead to the dark side.

Wouldn't Vader's red lightsaber have been constructed after the Clone Wars had ended? Anakin and Obi-Wan fight after General Grievous is dead and Order 66 has been executed, at which point Obi-Wan takes his ligthsaber. Anakin/Vader wouldn't get a chance to build a new lightsaber until after he's been severely burned and put into his spiffy new suit. The war is pretty much over by then, right? I see your conditions on including it as a clone wars era lightsaber, but I'm thinking it should be excluded outright (or at best a footnote).
He was allowed to wear all black so even the laziest viewer could easily pick out the guy who would eventually turn evil and wear all black body armour even amongst other Jedi. ;) Plus his kid wore a black jump suit in his third movie too, so, what choice did he have.... :D  As for a real (in-universe) answer: my only guess is that since he was in the midst of fighting a war, he just kept wearing his flight (jump)suit, which happened to be black. He was also forced to wear a glove. The tunic just completed the image, so the Council thought it fitting the Chosen One contrasted from the rest?

There are a lot of theories suggesting that Rey has already gotten Jedi training, perhaps one of the students from the academy that Kylo destroyed. In the script I believe that Luke certainly recognizes Rey when he turns around and sees her stood there, so I can't really give a definitive answer to this. Who knows? It's my personal opinion that she definitely has some prior training, otherwise the writing is terrible, she suddenly knows that there's such thing as a mind trick, and masters it on the first try? Then continues to defeat a trained dark side user? Too many coincidences.

@Jack - Why does heading a large organization and bringing others to the dark side suggest he's a Sith?

AFAIK - nothing in HPMR should even be analysed in comparison to the legitimate works. It's basically a completely divergent over-done tale using the same characters and settings but that's about it.

You've read the first and the last book only? How come?
What do you mean by "caveats"?

Is it necessary that he wakes up in the same dead body? And in case of imprisonment, suicide is always an option.
Tv-magic OFC! He had to get the money from somwhere to buy all the room he has in the latest episode. Sooo. hokus-pokus! He sold the house that isnt his to sell to get the cash. We cant have our hero go rob a bank or trip over a suitcase full of cash now can we? For all we know Juliette had a will where she left it all to Nick. All of this happened off-screen!!
Do we have reason to believe this is anyone other than Spock?
I don't think any serious canon allows that limitation but for some reason I vaguely remember an old cartoon that mentioned it. Possibly season 1 episode 28 of the 1960s New Adventures of Superman?
Do you want to clarify which Firefly actors qualify?   You imply they have to be main cast from your second question.   But I could lawyer the first to infer that any cameo on Firefly qualified as a Firefly actor.   That would be a very different question.
I don't see why religious prophecy falls outside the realm of fantasy. Are not prophecies very common literary devices for millennia now? The first that comes to my mind is Oedipus Rex, circa 300BC. The story begins with a short story about the end of Oedipus' life. The story is not quite religious, but future set nonetheless, for at least those few lines. Take Revelation as well, circa AD 100. This is certainly religiously prophetic, but denying the elements of fantasy is crazy.

What does "considered to be canon" mean? Considered by whom?
Wouldn't the case of the sugar water be similar to the brains in the tank, just on a smaller scale?  If we look at it like that, then yes it is possible. It should work in almost all cases as we have seen in OotP that it is possible to summon something that is suspended in a fluid.  During the department of mysteries struggle we see that ron was able to summon a brain that was suspended in a tank of fluid.
Using the estimates in Wookiepedia, **[!!!]** (1% survival rate with 100 or so surviving) this meant there were approximately 10,000 Jedi at the start of Order 66. –[SE](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/40252/how-many-jedi-were-there-at-the-time-of-the-purge). I'm cool with your math, but where did this 1% come from?
Where did the 10,000 Jedi number come from? This whole argument hinges on that, but you didn't cite a source for it.
In modern real life, the easiest way to make a ship in accessible is to scuttle it and ensure it sinks because no one around is technologically advanced to quickly, easily, and cheaply reclaim a ship from the bottom of the ocean. What is in this comparison that is being missed?
Are we limiting 'plants' to what we biologically define as plants? Or does something we would classify as 'fungi' count?
Why does a school need to have an interesting name? Heck, probably every city and town in the US has schools named after former presidents, In New York City, schools are called, for example, PS 12, PS 13, and PS 15. I think "interesting" is subjective, to boot.
I agree. Why didn't she choose more realistic names, like the Welsh township of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch ? It roughly translates to "Parish of Mary Hollow of the White Hazel near rapid Whirlpool and Parish of Tysilio with a red cave". Is that better than the American "Subtype School of Area" naming convention?

Worried about ol' Piers, are ya?
What vanishing glass? That brat found a way to climb in, and then lied his ass off, not being able to find a better excuse. And the keeper was surely mistaken, or tricked by a childish prank. (if you want to see an example of a magic world being kept hidden, told in large part also from the Muggle perspective, I would recommend to read the Master and Margarita, and see how the Muggle government tries to explain away - both to themselves and to the general population - weirder and weirder supernatural events)
`have their head cut` Heads cut off?
Is your premise that the war ended once four of the five kings were dead? Or that it ceased to be a war "of five kings" once one of them was gone? Or something else? From my point of view, the war is still on, as Stannis, the Greyjoys, and the Lannister-Baratheons are still pursuing their causes even without the aforementioned kings alive.
Is the fact that aguamenti works an okay source to say that there is a difference?
Where in canon did a squib do something a muggle can't? I'm pretty sure I saw a JKR quote saying Mrs. Figg fibbed about seeing the dementors, checking on that one.
Do you mean specifically in Harry Potter or in any piece of fiction?
I'm not sure creating a new AI with the same materials really counts as "overcoming rampancy". It's just making another AI. As for actually beating it, the possibilities that come up in Halo 5 are the only ones I can remember offhand. Also, are you sure *all* AIs are made from cloned human brains? I think Cortana said she's the only AI created from human tissue or something like that in Halo 5.

The word "oneiric" was actually used in the story?
Some clarifications are needed. 1. Are we only to consider named Sith Lords? For example, we don't know Tenebrous' master's name so do we include Tenebrous' assumed victory over that Sith Lord? 2. Are we to consider fights which were not depicted but for which we know the victor (e.g. [Darth Zannah](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Zannah) was succeeded by her apprentice Darth Cognus, so presumably Cognus won -- but that fight was not depicted in any source...

In X2 Wolverine was shot in the head and he was dead/unconscious for a while then the bullet just popped out and he woke up. I imagine the same would happen to Deadpool? In the Deadpool movie you could see that a lot of them were clean through and not stuck in him.
Are you asking about *during* or *after* the War of the Ring?
Is it because the wizard statue only received a glancing blow, as the quote states? The centaur statue "took the blast", which implies that the spell was a direct hit and therefore received the full impact from the magical energy fired at it.

Piling on: what's the deal with transporters needing human operators? For complex and high risk transport operations I can understand, but no Star Trek series ever seemed to progress to where the (otherwise highly advanced) computer could handle all aspects of transporting better than any human engineer. Heck, a computer can be a ship doctor, why not its transporter chief? (Pardon the word "human", I mean to include most aliens and Data as well.)
How do you distinguish fantasy from religion in very old writings?  Does Gilgamesh count as an answer?
Although surely not the first, would a character like Paul Atreides meet your criteria? He was the result of a long breeding program and not specifically chosen by fate, a religion grew up around him, so he's not the product of one.

I don't know of any canon statement that "the ship is not moving, but the space around it does"--the explanations I've seen involve some sort of "subspace bubble" surrounding the ship that somehow carries it faster than light.

Well, we should consider that C3PO was a droid built by a little boy-slave from scrap parts, and I don't think it was originally designed to a a diplomat. Then again: why did he even become one? If I recall correctly, in the prequels C3PO was mainly a servant in Anakin and Padme's house, it was after the events of Episode III he suddenly became a protocol droid (after his memory was erased). Maybe Senator Organa thought C3PO would make a great diplomat?
The answer to this question is going to be a long essay on the following:  (1) Gene Roddenberry explicitly didn't want it to be too militaristic (2) example of exceptional salutes, such as the Vulcan salute, other aliens, and alternate universes (3) Standing at attention during various formal scenarios  (3) MACOs from Enterprise?
Why should he need to? His movie was a remake of a movie based on a short story. I love his movie, but I fail to see why he would have any sort of blessing to give.

I think the more important question, is how have you been able to escape so many of the Marvel movies thus far, yet still be interested in seeing Civil War?  It's a continuation of the **Captain America** story, who is an **Avenger**, who has conflict with **Iron Man**.  That's 7 movies to capture everything. But if you just watch _Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_, that's probably 90% of what's important.

Do you mean "the Terminator films" rather than "the Terminator film" (since the latter seems to imply only the first film, whereas the Sarah Connor Chronicles treated T2 as part of its canon)? And if so do you want to consider all the Terminator films that have come out, or only T1 and T2 since the Sarah Connor Chronicles ignored the later ones?
What does it say in Legends about the Je'daii being "in balance", specifically? The Jedi of the prequel era believed the Chosen One would "bring balance to the Force", not eliminate the Dark Side, so it's apparently possible for Force-users who try to orient themselves towards the Light Side to nevertheless believe the Force itself needed to be balanced between Light and Dark. Maybe the belief is that one's conscious will should be oriented towards the Light while the Dark Side is more like an unconscious aspect that does need to be there, but shouldn't be consciously "fed"?
OK, Je'daii being sent to "find balance" as a corrective after turning to the light side does sound different from the Jedi--but again, can you give the specific Legends source where this happened so that people can verify what you're saying? As for your second comment, I think destroying the Sith was not the same as destroying the Dark Side, the idea seems to have been that the Sith were a danger because they were unbalancing the Force towards the Dark Side, see the ["Behind the Scenes"](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Chosen_One/Legends#Behind_the_scenes) section of the "Chosen One" article.
Thanks. Also, if you remember, could you mention which comic issue or book collection the incident with a Je'daii being sent to Ashla to find balance after turning light side happened?

I think another issue besides what is in Praxis' answer is that prevention alone requires the loss of liberty for the public.  For example, preventing a murder could require Pre-Crime to break into someone's home or do other things that would normally be illegal or violate someone's rights outside of the justice system.  If the basis of Pre-Crime is faulty, then how would you justify giving the agents of Pre-Crime the freedom to do such things as detain persons, search private property, trespass, etc.?

How is this any different from [your earlier question today](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/129437/5184)? from here: "So my question is can you use the Dark Side without the negative emotions normally associated with it, " from the other: "Can you use the Dark Side without using negative emotions? "
Harry Potter movies? No, they didn't make those, and if they did, they surely wouldn't have David Yates and/or Steve Kloves involved. The movies wouldn't add ridiculous stuff and subtract vital character development. Right?
Do you want to limit is specifically to comas, or would other examples of missing out on an apocalypse due to unconsciousness or convalescing in a hospital be OK? [This article](https://fictionmachine.com/2014/11/06/something-in-the-blood-28-days-later-2002/) mentions that the opening of 28 Days Later was inspired by a similar opening in *The Day of the Triffids*, but there the character was just in a hospital suffering from temporary blindness with his eyes bandaged.
Other than the moving staircases, you mean?
Do you mean why **didn't it** crumble?
Becase they're LG not CG? :)
@Nzall - Well, for starters at least one of your examples has the assistant play a part, which you've completely disregarded ("*with a little help of Danny Pink.*"). How much involvement can be disregarded?
-1 because I don't understand the question. What does it mean to "deconstruct" the bad guy's plans? The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction) was unhelpful, to say the least.
Fluffy as in cuddly?  Like a fluffy stuffed animal.  That was my instinct.  Didn't think that was much of a drift.

It's not fully discussed in the film.  It is in the comics. Would that be OK?
I felt that my answer was pretty comprehensive, with a direct quote from JKR to address your question. Is there anything else you'd like to see before considering an acceptance?
Along the same lines, did Betazoids cheat at poker? Deanna could at least sense when you are bluffing, or when you had a great hand. Full blooded Betazoids could presumably read your mind and know precisely  what cards you were holding.
have we seen dragons melt chains on the show (or read it in the books) before? please remind me when... I cannot recall that ever occurring.
Is Rocky Horror sufficiently on-topic that we can ask general questions about the non sci-fi elements of it?
Huh. So I can ask "Why did the farmer plant an apple tree instead of another fruit in 'Farmers in the Sky'"? Weird.
Since when does a roll on a snare drum follow a laugh? Do you mean [this](https://www.youtube.com  v=kHYiyv68q2o)? (That's not a roll)
If you apply enough force you can move a human quite easily. Force = mass * acceleration. Quicksilver (unsurprisingly) can accelerate a lot. Have you ever been tackled by someone running at full speed?
So this question is looking for the first appearance of the trope in *literature*, and the question on M&TV is looking for the first appearance of the trope in movies and TV?
I'm not sure I understand. You first answered the questions about Witcher and only then read the book?
For example, did he invent any sort of futuristic technology? Was his genius the result of mutation, enhancement, alien involvement, etc?
#2 may be Larry Niven's "The Changelings", but I haven't been able to dig out the book it's in. Could it be a magazine?
I'm sure I read the 2. story. Was one of the creatures wearing a hat of the first crew and throws a fruit as an attack? The 3. I think I remeber, too. The twist as I remember was, that the civilization was very primitive (with cruel rituals) and was "upgraded" and rushed to become modern and totally looked like a modern culture. But in the end, we learn, that they didn't abandom their cruel rituals and that they only were modern on the surface. The book (german edition) could have been white with blue picture on the cover. But this could be misleading.
weightlessness of plasma What? Plasma has mass; it must therefore have weight. Maybe not *much* depending on the exact material, but it won't be truly weightless. I think you need to go back a few steps before trying to clarify any scientific questions.
Would you accept the Super Mario Bros Super Show cartoon as canon? It says they got there after trying to unclot a toilet, or something...that's what I remember from the show intro...
Are you interested only in SMB(1) for the NES or would you be willing to look at answers from later games where the plot is far more developed?
It would be really weird if they were in a relationship... I mean how exactly would that work anyhow?
You mean refs of other books in Dark Tower or the other way round?
Do deleted scenes count? Because Shaak-ti is a limbo death where she is killed by grievous right in front of Anakin and obi-wan in a deleted scene.
Which episode is the earlier example?  Sinclair did beat the snot out of a Minbari in the pilot, but he was in full riot gear at the time, and he still took a beating.
Don't forget that the Tully forces are much more needed for fighting in Winterfell than needed to sit-around in the Riverlands. Ceding the castle made that happen. Brienne possibly told him as such? But, it'd be pretty cool if Jamie slaughtered the retreating Tully forces.
Are you looking for show canon only or are book answers fine as well?
Does Kirk's dad count? ;)
Service length: In movies, series or years?
Doesn't the accepted answer already have the sort of sources you're looking for? I've already presented everything that is available through the in-game books and dialog within the games. There doesn't seem to be anything else either: I've read the licensed novels (trash though they are) and vampirism isn't brought up. I've never seen a developer comment on this, probably because whether vampires sleep isn't relevant to the gameplay.
There’s the Ludicrous Patents Office in the Ministry of Magic (*Order of the Phoenix*); does that count?

Are there actual retail sales people depicted in the film? As I recall, everything one needs seems to be provided by one's faction.

Why would he use a long-winded command like 'replicate a cup of hot Earl Grey tea' when just 'tea Earl Grey' works? What I wonder is, why doesn't he just say 'the usual'?
is this the right place for such a question? Seems a better fit for Arqade as DK isn't really fantasy or SciFi
Disclaimer: I know nothing about this series. - Is it possible that they've taken the dubbed source from somewhere and edited out the advert breaks?
Cartoon or live-action?
I know it's not a child's series, but have you looked at *Space: Above and Beyond*?
Not putting it as an answers because my confidence is low, but could it have been Deepwater Black (released in the US under the name Mission Genesis)?  Was YTV, not Space, but the timeframe's roughly right... unfortunately I remember very few details.
UFO? https://www.youtube.com  v=8CvURidpkCY
You mean my edits to your question?
An Ewok rainbow bridge? Everything else I can accept, but that stretches my suspension of disbelief too far.

Honestly most fantasy writers don't care about the level of realism you're asking about.  These winters have been confirmed to be magical in nature by GRRM. As such, is there any reason to believe the life cycles of animals might not also be magical in order to survive these winters?

Didn't they fund themselves by selling blockbuster movies?
Dementors dont obey anyone, not even the commands of the Ministry of Magic. what makes you say that?
As it stands this is to broad. It needs to cover *either* the comics or the movies. Movies should be answerable.  Comics may still be too broad, and/or opinion based due to your wording "most prone to fight" do you want numbers,  or most antiheroic?
Does repeatedly fighting the same person count each time? i.e. does every instance of Hulk fighting Wolverine count as 1 or the dozens of times they've fought?

P.s. Did she burn down House of the undying in show? Or was it just Pyat Pree she killed? Either way, Warlocks are justified in seeking vengeance.
So you want something that pre-dates Star Wars: Rebels but is part of the original "G-Canon"?
I felt that my answer was pretty comprehensive given that the map below is printed in an authorised work. Are you anticipating that there will be any additional detail that can be added before you consider an acceptance?
Why do you think she acquired it somehow? There are plenty of stories of people born with photographic memories.
yes, but well over a decade ago. Is there something I'm forgetting that suggests there's more to it than that?
Where did you see it?
@iMerchant Huh, I would have put the bottom left one as Galactica, not the Phoenix, since Cochrane's ship only has one link to the nacelles each -- shown [here](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/9/99/Phoenix_space.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100605052029&path-prefix=en)-- this one has three, as (*Classic*) Galcactica does...
I'm only know the TV show. Do you have quotes from the book suggesting he wanted to get out of the marriage?
Is it actually established that starkiller base was ilum in the movies or novel?
Are you suggesting that Peter Mayhew and Kenny Baker did *not* make the sounds of their characters? If so, you should probably mention who/what *does* make the sounds, since you are implying that Peter Mayhew and Kenny Baker didn't make the sounds for their characters.
What do you mean colonized? Jupiter has a station around it, but obviously there isn't a colony on it's surface. Does that mean it's colonized or not?
Aren't Pluto and Ceres, and the sun celestial bodies? (Just asking out of idle curiosity, I have no idea of any if them has been colonised in Star Trek.)
Are you willing to consider non-canon sources? I have an answer based on a video game.
Maybe a better description of what made it seem like a cyber world, or futuristic? Were there flying cars, holograms, random lights on the edges of things?
Any chance it's the Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3D?
What about the maps in the books?
Was it not Sallador Saan's fleet, which Stannis had hired? It was in the books, the rest of Stannis' fleet burned in the wildfire on Blackwater. When Stannis ran out of money, Sallador ran away with his fleet. I think they carried some of that to the show.
I don't really understand the end of your question. Why would the show address whether Bran can 'get it up'? And how? Bran certainly has more pressing matters than to muse on his potential fertility. A random attempted-masturbation scene or a furtive age-inappropriate liason with Meera would be a bit gratuitous, even in GoT! And why would any other other character muse on Bran's fertility when most think he was killed by Theon, and the few who know he wasn't don't know if he survived in the wilderness or where he is?
`Or are all Time Lords like him?` I don't want to spoil anything for you, but you'll find out eventually that it's a moot question.
possibly under the influence from the drugs that gave him the munchies in The Amazing Spider-Man [citation needed] I don't think that actually happened in the movie. What movie did _you_ watch?
I'm not usually a big stickler for doing a lot of research before asking a question... but really?
Are you looking for these specific phrases? Because arguably other phrases like "May [the Force]/[God] be with you" similarly use "the Force" as a stand-in.

How do you define "black" when discussing non-human races?
What do you mean "on the same day"?  Towel Day is an annual event, and Discworld doesn't even have the same length of year as Earth does.
Part 1 - Wouldn't the Empire be far more concerned about covering up their ongoing search for the Death Star plans? It's one thing to cover up arresting Leia to avoid sympathy for the Rebellion, and yes they want to question her in secrecy about the Death Star plans and the secret Rebel base, but how would anyone make a connection between Leia and slaughtered Jawas on Tatooine, especially since the Empire controlled and manipulated the Holonet news anyway? The only people who that information would be meaningul towards would be members of the Rebellion.
James also makes an appearance in the Star Fox Command game for DS, in which it is explicitly stated that Fox is the only one who can see him. Falco even says "You seein' things? There's nobody there!". There are other things, such as Pigma's taunts during Lylat Wars, "Daddy screamed REAL good before he died!", and "Daddy's gonna be waiting for you in hell!"  in the Japanese version.
How wide a sway does it have to have to count as a "Nazi-based *civilization*"? In Schachner's 1933 "The Robot Technocrat" the future U.S. of 1954 is (quoting Bleiler's review) "politically shattered into a welter of political parties . . . Each of them constitute a small dictatorship with absolute leader private army of storm troopers or strongarm men, and a policy of ruthlessness. Most troublesome of all is the Nationalist Party headed by Adolph Hiller [sic] . . " That one is pretty clearly not a "civilization" but how big does it have to be? A medium size country? a continent? a planet?
By legal punishment do you mean being imprisoned by government forces sanctioned by legitimate governing bodies or going through due process and the various legal procedings? Because he has gone through the former but not the latter as far as I know. The former being just as much a legal punishment as the latter as it would fall on government forces to carry out these sanctions. Also, in many cases Banner would be considered not responsible due to not being able to control Hulk reasonably and at worse would be sentenced to anger management ^.^
Why would you even care? The show has never paid much attention to all members of the Kingsguard, and I don't see how knowing their identities would even be relevant.
I thought Harry was born when the prophecy was made? Hence why Voldemort was able to come to his conclusion that it was Harry.

Obviously the rain keeps the seas full.  I mean, think about it in reverse.  If the seas weren't running off the edge of the Disc, what would stop the rain from filling them beyond their shores and flooding everything?
disney canon or legends?
Why do you say "Inventory"? It can as well be the specificaition (complement 32 - i.e. capacity to carry 32 torpedoes). Unless the Voyager class has many subversions due to refits - that will be the same for all of them. Which means that knowing what class of ship the voyager is gives you the capacity. There is no indication this is a "current" load level.
Why *wouldn't* they relish a viable alternative to the Lannisters? Especially after the good job Sansa and Baelish did manipulating their sense of loyalty in season 4, and given the influence Baelish has on them now. The most stubborn and Baelish-skeptical of them are the Royces, but that's balanced by their also having [quite strong historical and cultural ties to the north](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/100633/31938) (which do exist in the show world - Sansa played on them)
@Aegon Okay, who? Who looks like a convincing candidate?

Have you finished the Cursed Child? Draco himself speaks to this - you have to read between the lines a bit, but essentially he was lonely. He said he envied the friendship the trio had, and that Crabb and Goyle were indeed buffoons and lackeys, not true friends.

Given the time period, the furry ears, and the fact that you describe it as having Final Fantasy-like graphics, is it possible that this was a trailer for Final Fantasy 14, the MMO game originally released in 2010? I haven't reviewed the trailers to see if there's a matching scene with a monster, but check out [the cat-eared Miqo'te species](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Miqo'te#Gallery) from FF14 and see if that matches the characters you're thinking of.

Misdirection and people simply not looking for it. Who normally scans the hands of magicians to see if they're missing fingers, and in what manner?
I agree that John Stewart is awesome, but is there any basis to your "dislike" of Jordan and thinking of him as a "a twit" other than not having grown up with his version of Green Lantern?  If you think of him as a villain rather than a hero due to his "Parallax" phase, I might understand, but I suspect you aren't aware of that....
Have you read The Hedge Knight? It includes a first-person account of a man dealing with the bureaucracy of trying to sign on to the lists at a tourney when his knightly status is uncertain. The Mystery Knight also has another in different (more complicated) circumstances. Bascially, like everything in ASOIAF, it's based on implied consensus of the powerful ("power resides where..." yadda yadda), every rule has a little flexibilty if the right people vouch for you.
I'm not surprised that you have, just checking before writing an answer since you link to the wiki and don't mention the stories or characters directly. I'd have thought your question was answered by the cases of Dunc (questionable status and lack of evidence overlooked when the right Targ vouches for him) and Ball (questionable status and lack of evidence overlooked because he's seemingly in the right faction and the consensus among this crowd is that he's amusing not problematic)?
A lot of details are a bit off, but I'll ask just to be safe... any chance you're thinking of William Gibson's "Johnny Mnemonic"?
Do you remember roughly when you read it? That might give an upper bound for publishing date.
Some similarities with SeaQuest DSV with Roy Scheider? Also present was a dolphin character called Darwin who, due to technological advances, was able to communicate with the crew. It originally aired between 1993 and 1996 that was renamed seaQuest 2032 in its final season.

While he was at, save the mother too? Granted, Robert probably would have hired the Faceless Men if they had all escaped. On the other hand, the dragon needs three heads... We have 1, Dany herself (duh), a possibe 2, now that R+L=J is confirmed. The 3 spot is still up for grabs
You don't recall whether the prisoner was male or female? Do you recall what he/she was in for? murder, treason, forgery, jaywalking?

Hey.  Quick question - wouldn't it be 01:12:12:.5 instead of 20:12:12:.5?  (Assuming the .5 is 12pm, and also assuming date before month).  Or 12:01:12:.5, if it was supposed to be month before date (I'm trying to check, not assume, if the numbers are scrambled - different places change the order).
I don't think it would be very heroic for our protagonists to lose their temper with Malfoy too often. He's been taught his ways by his parents and is ignorant, but would it be the right thing to hit him for it more often than they do? He does get punched in PoA and hexed unconscious the following year after all.
Was the original language Norwegian, or was it translated? Also, can you remember the name of the anthology?

Hi Vahn. Thank you for submitting your question. Too, for putting in as much detail as you could remember. To your note, this may be a tough one to identify as there is not much to go on.  Are there any other details you can help provide?  E.g. where did you watch it? In what language was it broadcast?  Was it animated or live-action?  Etc.  Anything else you can provide may help.

What do you think about the answer here? Is it the one? Not a perfect match, but some things do overlap.
Two questions. One, since you ruled out destroying ships, does taking action or refusing to take action that directly (and willfully) results in death count? Two, does the death have to be on screen or can it be mentioned to have occurred in the character's past?

Ferengi always struck me as being impulsive. I can see how if Quark can delegate his work responsibilities (he is the boss after all) and just spend an entire day playing he would.

Can we give answers where the cannibalism would be a spoiler for the story?
This sort of thing is commonplace in movies. Hollywood not only ignores the text of books, but documented history - they would make Jesus and Buddha into bad guys if it suited their purposes. Is WWZ the first movie in which you've noticed this?
So, you are certain that it's part of a series? Or were you just left with the impression that it was unfinished? And "bear or wind" is an odd range of powers... is there anything that you remember that suggests it being one of those two?
I've wondered that myself.  Well-programmed device, or conscious actor?
All of these other examples were alone when disconnected, right? Might be something to do with there being more than one of them.
@Matt What do you mean by "it doesn't affect them"? What is "it"?
Is there more than one Washington in the US?
@Skooba - I mean, was it definitely Washington DC or could it have been Washington, Idaho or Washington, New York or whatever?
Is the Fisher King referenced by The Waste Land the same one from Arthurian legend?
Is he perchance wounded, and must wait in an difficult-to-access location for someone to heal him?
After seeing your comments below, I think perhaps you could still be a little more clear. Is there some more general suspected bias in George Martin’s writing that you’re trying to get at, and you think the difference in descriptions of their appearances is one sign of that? In that case, I think explicitly asking for evidence (or lack thereof) of this bias might reverse a lot of those downvotes. Then people can give whatever explanation they want. Part of the issue is that from reading this question, I can’t guess what sort of bias you’re seeking to identify.
also... I thought the idea was that the demigods didn't _actually_ have ADHD -- their demigod status was causing them to be misdiagnosed. Presumably, once they knew their heritage and were among other demigods it would stop being a problem?
Could an obsidian blade be considered to be made from “black steel”? Or indeed, perhaps, one of Valyrian steel? I believe it is said to be unusually dark.

I'm pretty sure I've read this... can you provide *any* other details (no matter how fuzzy) that might narrow it down? Was it first-person or third-person? Male or female protagonist, or no protagonist? Any other effects of the rain? Anything odd besides the rain? Any character traits that stand out? Any sense of the time period in which it occurs? How many pages, roughly?
How is raising a clone army any different from building a million droids in a factory? Droids like R2D2 and C3PO are sentient, have emotions, and are considered property. Clones are also sentient, have emotions, and are considered property. Slaves are also sentient, have emotions, and are considered property. If the Jedi (and others) accept droids as property, then why set the dividing line at people with electronic brains instead of biological brains?
There are two subterfuges involved here. Are you asking about both of them?

@Meerkat Our ancient omniimpotent spacewizards can achieve anything. And if shockwaves of explosions happen in ring form, a ring blockade is even more effective. But would that mean, that if the blockaded planet would be destroid, the explosion would happen in the same plane as the blockade?

If you're not sure, ***investigate first what exactly is said***. Your entire question is based on an incorrectly remembered quote. [KIRA: "Isn't there a period of adjustment that joined Trills have to go through where people are comparing them to previous hosts? I'm sure it'll pass." -- EZRI: "You're right. The last five Dax hosts went through this."](http://www.chakoteya.net/DS9/557.htm)

@ibid - Are you asking about foreshadowing in the Potter books? I took the quote to mean she gave them special privileged information - which we probably haven't had access to.
Are people really so unfamiliar with the phrase "Deus ex machina" these days that so few connect it with the title? Or are they just reaching to ignore it?
This question is left open but my rogue one questions get closed for being about future works? I don't get it.
In the original trilogy, intergalactic travel was never a thing (except for Reapers, and they were implied to be vaguely close on the galactic scale).  Probably because of exactly what you point out. So answer is... something changed?  The game isn't out yet, so it' not like there's context to compare against.
Since the question is as you noted deleted, what was its premise? I'm curious.
What evidence is there that makes you think it does require being anointed by a septon in the time of ASOIAF?
I'm of the opinion that brevity is at the heart of a good question. Adding a vast chunk of pointless (albeit relevant) context isn't necessary since anyone capable of answering the question will already know the context. In this case, you could probably boil it just down to a 10 word question; "**Why did *everyone* at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries assume that this character was dead?**" with a picture of Sirius behind a spoiler tag in the body of the question.
It probably comes down to the rather exceptional magical skills of Dumbledore. He would probably stop him Disapparating (not easy for most, but he's Dumbledore) or could he even put him into some sort of stasis or other unconscious state?
Are you sure about the opal part? Just checking because opal eliminates almost every potential result.
Hi Laura. Welcome to StackExchange. Hopefully we can help you with your search. Are there any additional details you might be able to provide about the book in question?  E.g. when did you read it? Did it seem like it was new (or old) at the time?  Do you remember anything about the cover?  Was it a juvenile fiction item or an adult book? You said the girl might have been traveling with her family. Was it just them?  Or were they perhaps part of a larger colony ship?   Any other item you can remember may help with identifying the story. Thanks.

Shouldn't he introduce himself as 1824, FN-1824?
Wasn't he supposed to be JB-007 since he was played by Daniel Craig? Where did you get the name FN-1824?
@Werrf - You didn't say that it was the *invisible rain* that made the holes in the umbrella. Also, what happened to the people who weren't carrying umbrellas?
There were a couple different cuts of *Dark City*, and honestly the lisp makes me think that's it (Keifer stands out in that movie) but I don't remember those quotes in that movie either (the crazy cop might come close?).
Whence means "from where", so "from whence" is a bit... redundant, no?
@Dumbledorality Well, there's a lot of assumptions in reading that much into the Remembrall incident. One is discounting luck, two is that a specific skill was involved in making that happen (which exactly?), three is that it's something he didn't pick up in normal life (e.g. practice juggling oranges in the kitchen or whatever), four is that it was something he inherited (when his father might have had different skills), five is that he got something from James Potter and not Lily Evans (who was also talented), six is that it wasn't a quality related to Voldemort's fragment, etc.....
@Lorendiac Which of [these stories](http://storypilot.com/tt.php?keywords=dinosaur) satisfy your criteria?
Hm. What about the Rivvers of Time stories? Edit: I take it back, that started 1956.
How do you count Pelucidar, which has dinosaurs, travel, and weird time effects?
What is the question here? It feels quite broad at the moment. Are you looking for expanded "back story" in-universe? An explanation of real-world phenomena being referenced?
A more interesting question would be, "did anyone think this schedule through?"  If the contest is to be every five years, and only sixth and seventh year students are eligible to compete, then 3/7ths of students will never be eligible to compete at all...  But then, lots of the things wizards do seem to be completely arbitrary, so I can't say that it's out of character.

Since it's impossible to know how long it's been since you went to high school, adding a date might help, as well as whether you think this was a new book at the time, or if it was already older.  That can help pin down the year, which might make the book easier to find.  Also, was it part of the curriculum, or did you just happen to read it independently while you were in high school?
is there any accounting for the possibility that perhaps the internal tools themselves can rotate to be accessible via the most applicable port? Also - it's a droid - it can probably account for rotation / speed, etc...in it's approach to whatever it needs to interact with

Is it possible you're mixing up two stories?  Sturgeon did have a novella called "Baby is Three" which involved a gestalt being that lived like a family, each with different psi powers (including teleporting twins), with "Baby" being the brain.  It was later made into "More than Human."  But IIRC, the children were all young, not quasi-immortal (or at least, too young to say for sure),
This is a duplicate of http://movies.stackexchange.com/q/63663/9391 "How did Newt Scamander realize “someone's” real identity?" from Movies SE.  See answers there.

is there not a witcher from a different school that is seen in witcher 1? it has been soo long I played it but I seem to remember a guy that was not from Kaer Morhen.
It's possible that his refusal to outright reject her is being interpreted by her as "maybe there's a chance," given the whole brutal honesty thing.  I don't have easy access to the entire series, but I seem to recall an episode, probably later in the show's run, where she admitted to Troi that she knew Picard wasn't really interested (or WTE.)  IIRC, she and Troi were in the brig of an alien vessel at the time, maybe Romulan?  I think the plot revolved around her using another man to try and make Picard jealous.
Are you looking for an in-universe or out-of-universe answer?
I'm curious - if you thought The Architect was lying, what did you think was actually happening (both in this film and the sequel)? I mean, the reason Neo didn't enter the Source was due to Trinity, not the Architect. The Architect was arguing that Neo **should** enter the Source, which **was the objective of Neo's mission anyway**. So...what exactly was he gaining by lying?

Can you give the formula for evaluating the single best answer? I'm confused exactly what the scoring criteria is for this question. Without the scoring rubric I don't see how this question is reasonably answerable.
Is there any actual evidence that they *weren't* in the room with him?  Rumours that Mr Murray is some sort of recluse or he was liable to be difficult about being together with a new generation of Ghostbuster girls?  Anything?  Sure, I get that it's *possible* these scenes were all shot separately, but it's also *possible* they were shot together.  It would be more effort and more time (and more billable hours for crew, stunt doubles, and post-production) to shoot Mr Murray apart from the new girls, so why would they have done this?
@Valorum what grounds would they have to sue him for refusing to do a cameo?!?
The part from 0:43 to 0:49 in your clip, where Bill Murray uses his stick to push something they're holding, that doesn't do it for you?
If “the Secret” allows the resolution of any interpersonal conflict to the complete satisfaction of both parties, does the story mention why the conspiracy bothers incarcerating this fellow, when they could resolve the situation to *both* their satisfaction?

Picard killed himself once.  Does that count?
P-Wings being "Paratroopa" wings? Seems a little odd. Will have to do some checking, but it seems more likely that the name come from the fact that the "Run Power" meter that enabled you to fly in Super Mario Bros 3 was a gauge ending with a **"P"**. Since the item basically worked by locking the gauge so that it was always full, it seems appropiate to think that the name was linked to that?

Hello Dancreepermaker and welcome to the SF & Fantasy Stack. While we would love to help you find this book, the description as it stands is a bit vague, with the mutated wasps as the only feature. Is there anything else you remember that could narrow it down? Did you read it as an e-book? What did the cover look like? Do you remember more of the plot? Names of characters? Oh, and by the way, have you taken the [tour] yet?
I think you need to narrow this question to one particular question - you have seven question marks in the text, and they aren't all asking the same thing, so which do you want answers to address? I also don't really follow the connection between "outside of time" and "immortal", but maybe that's the question?

Why did Julius Caesar use Caesar ciphers if you can break them so easily with a simple frequency analysis? Because back then people didn't know how to break it, now we have better cryptography. Similarly, in potterverse they now have safer locks which Alohomora can't unlock.
Did you just say that Hermione is *average* ?
Um...doesn't your question answer itself?  The character appears and kills the PC (thanks for the spoiler, BTW) before running off.  This implies that they exist at the same time.  If they exist at the same time in that ending, they must presumably exist in all endings, since that ending (to my knowledge) doesn't involve any time-travel shenanigans that would be responsible for the DA's existence.
@holmes200 Are you asking for opinions about who is the biggest bad ass in Middle Earth after Sauron? Or are you asking for citations from the stories showing who is the biggest threat to Middle Earth? If you are asking for opinions, then this is not the right forum. The problem with opinion based questions is that there is no one right answer, nor are there supporting answers. Just a bunch of conflicting opinions. That's why people downvote opinion based questions.

As some other answers explain well, I think this has to come down to the strength and experience of the wizards involved. Could Dumbledore or McGonagall deflect two or more at once from a lesser wizard? Absolutely. Could Colin Creevey against Bellatrix? Almost certainly not. And Hermione vs Dolohov for example? I think that would be very uncertain and depend on specific details of the confrontation.

There are Legends novels showing Life Day being celebrated all across the galaxy, and not just by Wookies.  But seriously, why are you worrying about this?  There are bigger questions!  I am more concerned about why the Jefferson Starship had microphones that looked like light sabers.

+1 This is a great point! For the starships, with powerful thrusters, it takes dozens of minutes to reach the core, but Sidious falls into it in a couple of seconds? His throne room sure was in a tower, on the surface of Death Star II, so he should fall the very same distance. If I had to retcon this, I'd say Sidious hit only a generator or something in the bottom of the tower, not the core reactor.

What is your basis for saying that this had **never** happened before? And that Obi-Wan Kenobi definitely was **first** to find a way to make his body vanish into thin air as he was about to die? I've read a fair number of licensed Star Wars novels, and I've never run across those particular assertions before, so I'm wondering where you got the idea that Obi-Wan's case was unique and unprecedented in all the thousands of years that the Jedi Order had already existed. (As opposed to just being a *very rare* phenomenon.)
As near as I can tell, between memory and some rapid googling, you have to deal with more or less three canons: the original trilogy (where every jedi example we saw became a force ghost), the second trilogy (where Qui Gon was the only ghost voice to be heard), and current Disney. Second Trilogy apparently Qui Gon was the last person to learn the technique which had been forgotten, but taught it to Yoda and ObiWan (who perfected it). The real question is in original trilogy canon, Vader must have known all Jedi make ghosts and should not have been surprised. Did he just take that into account?
Do you think I should post that as an answer? (With additional explanation and the relevant parts from the Reddit post quoted, of course.) The only reason I haven't yet was that your question currently seems to be asking for some kind of official ranking or grade, rather than just a raw analysis of Twilight's demonstrated abilities.
out of galaxy is likely entirely incorrect. Do you mean "out of the system"?

I'm not sure I understand this question. Are you only asking if a Thestral tail hair core wand is unique? Or are you thinking that Voldemort had the Elder Wand when he duelled Harry in *Goblet*? (He didn't). As for the core, remember that Ollivander came to prefer his three chosen cores, but that wands can be made with all kinds of alternatives.
A damn good question. I've rewatched to look at light sources. The base appears to be in orbit of a small white star which is only ever glimped in reflections and at the very top of the screen (mostly shaded by lens-flare). There's no good indication how they turn the lights down. Presumably it's polarised glass?
Does 7 of 9 count?
This sounds like the manga One Piece, which is set in an ocean world divided by a long, narrow mountain range. Are you absolutely sure that it wasn't a natural barrier that divided the world you're trying to recall?

Most star destroyers in the original trilogy were not painted white but in fact were grey (?). Perhaps you could clarify this a bit?
Thanks for the clarification with Vestak. Although that leads to the question of why Vestal appears 3 times, yet appears to be a small US town. Is it a reference to something I don't know about?

It makes sense to me that Han wouldn't have wanted to be caught smuggling valuable goods (legal or not) without the knowledge and blessing of the Empire.  Likewise, Luke's comment about the "spice freighter" reminds me of the great tea clipper fleets from the 1700s, ferrying tea and spices to Britain from the East Indies.

in a book where one of the foundational points is that the network allows completely anonymous yet full interaction ('racting'), it's completely credible.

@JHZ "Why do future humans use a name that current humans generally don't?" An Anglo-centric thinking is occurring. The Romantic languages and surprisingly some non-Roman languages use words like Luna or Lune. And, albeit rarely, you will hear English speakers use the term. In fact, growing up in a bilingual province in a bilingual country, I was surprised when I discovered in adulthood that Luna _was not_ the name of The Moon (in the same way we call "The Planet" Earth, I thought Luna was the moon's name.).

I seem to recall an episode of *Sliders* that featured a world where everyone wore collars that would zap them if they told a lie (I think the whole city of San Francisco was a big prison or something like that, and the collars were part of a prisoner's sentence.)  The force of the shock was proportionate to how "big" the lie was, so making obviously false statements ("the sky is green!") or a rapid series of smaller lies would result in death.

What consequences would you expect? They were acting on orders from Starfleet and didn't get caught (the only Romulan that knew what happened was captured and taken w/ them back to Federation territory). The whole 'didn't get caught' thing is the big reason why there are no consequences imo
The other answer indicates that a Sith name comes **at the appropriate moment** through the will of the Force. Why would he need a Sith name before then?
Sith name should somehow define him, and induce powerful Dark side emotions. Considering that name is given at the beginning of Sith's "career", it is doubtful it could be chosen without help of the Force. For example, who would have know that Anakin being a father would influence his fateful decision to terminate Sith Order ?

Of course it's intentional. It wouldn't be a very interesting episode if it went: "Captain, we're picking up some strange energy readings from an anomaly in space." "Really? In that case, plot a course around it, let's not interfere. Captain's Log, Stardate 3864.03. We detected something. Rather than investigate, as an exploration ship might be expected to do, we decided not to risk it." *Credits roll*
The problem with most speculation here is that it ties Dumbledore down to the abilities of other magical folk. Given that his entire character is based around him being one of the most gifted wizards who ever lived, I'm not sure we can speculate based on what happens when other wizards Apparate. Have you any other instances when Dumbledore Apparates and does cause a bang, for example?

Mentally disabled isn't a term I'm familiar with. Is that something used in non-American English? We typically say, "mentally ill," here. (You *could* qualify as legally/medically disabled based on mental illness, I think, but I'd expect something like, "disabled because of mental illness," to describe that.)
I'm willing to agree that all (most) demons are *humanoid,* but that doesn't necessarily mean they're "part human."  Lorne's species, for example, comes from a parallel dimension, despite *looking like* humans with green skin.  Interbreeding might be possible between some species (one or two species do it on screen), but what evidence do we have that all or even most can do so?

I doubt that using a killing curse on a Horcrux would damage your soul in the same way that killing an actual person would. Are you sure? Destroying a horcrux is essentially destroying part of a person's soul. Is it different because you're only killing 1/8th of a person?

If each class was an hour, why would Rowling have needed to mention Moody putting Harry through extra paces *directly* after telling us the length of the class?  The wording there strongly suggests that it's an explanation, meaning that an hour is unusually long for a period, meaning that the 45 minutes you gleaned is probably correct.

Haven't seen the episode in a long time - but how badly was John injured? Could that explain him saying Shayera's name? Also (if I recall correctly) he and Shayera were somewhat estranged after the attempted Thanagarian invasion; this may have been done deliberately to make it clear that John did still have feelings for her (a bit harder to do with the cast expansion in the "Unlimited" seasons).

I think those adequately cover your questions.

is there any evidence that they are wearing the rings during the journey? We see Galadriel reveal her ring to Frodo in Lothlorien, but we don't know that she continues to wear it. Gandalf is shown to be wearing his ring at the Gray Havens, but I don't think he has shown to be prior to that. Ultimately, it wouldn't matter if they did or didn't wear them I think. He is the Lord of the Rings and would have knowledge of them regardless.

The distinction is that Jaime was a bodyguard for the king who was not supposed to get involved in the political machinations within the realm, while Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon were not bodyguards. Also the king and his son attacked members of the Stark and Baratheon families, which made people think their oaths were pointless. Why swear loyalty to somebody who killed your father and brother? So from their point of view, it is not hypocrisy to scorn Jaime. Other families on the other hand did scorn Jaime and are guilty of hypocrisy. IMHO.

Is that _Artificial_ Gravity, or just regular gravity working in a place where it shouldn't?
Does your question presuppose that the concept of Artificial Gravity was introduced in a work of fiction? If the idea of rotating a spaceship to provide Artificial Gravity was proposed in nonfictional writings of rocket scientists *before* its first use in fiction, which do you want? Perhaps only the first *fictional* use would be on topic here.
Are you pretty sure it was in one of the two magazines you mentioned, or could it just as well have been in some other magazine such as *Astounding*?
You say you aren't asking a science question, which is fair. But wouldn't an acceptable answer to this question explain how C-14 is consumed in the production of Au-197? Is that not what you want to know?
A question: Back in the Golden Age (up through, say, the early-to-mid 1950s), Quality and Fawcett were comic book publishing companies which, at the time, had nothing to do with DC. But DC eventually acquired the trademarks from both companies, but not the copyrights on old stories (or so I've heard), and DC eventually started integrating some superheroes from each company into its own comic books. (For instance, Captain Marvel was from Fawcett, and Plastic Man was from Quality.) Would you count Golden Age Fawcett and Quality superheroes as being eligible under your "DC or Marvel heroes" rule?

Why would the Rebels or Imperials trust any droid? Let's not limit the question to R2D2. Couldn't hackers hack into a droid, download their own software on it, and take command over the droid? It happens to laptops and smartphones in real life, so why should droids be any different?

The bold sentence seems a bit at odds with the title and rest of the body. Do you want a comparison between film Ego and the usual comic Celestials, or do you want to know about other times that there has been an unusual Celestial?

Correct me if I’m wrong, but the disruption to the timeline occurred before Kal-El’s pod entered the atmosphere, chronologically. Right?
Well, if you prefer, the light from Earth reached the pod long before it reached Earth. That could have been sufficient to perturb its orbit such that it would land in a different place. (And viz a viz weather, who says it *wasn’t*? His pod could have been hit by a tornado for all we know. It could have been knocked off course by a collision with a flying super-individual. It could have hit some space junk created by whatever space program wouldn’t have existed without Flashpoint. The possibilities are endless.)

Your first spoiler block happens in first 15 minutes or so of the movie; there's no need to hide it.  I don't think the second spoiler block is even mentioned in the movie, and it's completely irrelevant to the movie anyway; why hide it?

Define "Force user". Specifically a Jedi, someone _trained_ to use the Force (even if another faction trained them), anyone who _uses_ the Force knowingly (even if untrained), or anyone who uses the Force unknowingly (e.g. the theory that Anakin's engineering genius stems from him unknowingly using the Force when he really wants to make something work)?

While I think this is an interesting question, it seems like there was no effort to research it first, and it seems incredibly odd to me to ask this question *based on the cover*.  The whole point of titles like this is to entice people to read the book.  Why would you expect the answer to be obvious from the cover?

Are you assuming that there are no other gods but the Greek pantheon? All that he was claimed to have killed were the Olympians.
[Why didn't Harry die in the dark forest?](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/35074/70236) - dupe-hammer at will.
Not completely clear what you're looking for. For one thing, the first *mention* of the grandfather paradox may well have taken place in a non-fictional context, i.e., in reviews or *discussions* of time-travel stories, such as in the letter columns of the old magazines. I assume that you want the first grandfather paradox in a *fiction story*, is that right? Well, what about those stories where a character sets out to kill his grandfather but fails for one reason or another, e.g. kills the wrong man? Or do you insist and the grandfather-killer disappearing?
Just because we don't _see_ him perform his "usual" magic, doesn't mean he hasn't. He was in control of the ministry by then, he could have done pretty much anything he wanted off-screen (... off-page?) prior to the Battle of Hogwarts
To be clear, nuclear weapons as known after 1945? Or nuclear weapons as in anything written before 1945 that could have been realistically retconned as a nuclear weapon?
Fawkes the phoenix? The portraits in the office? They're both unknown quantities in how far they reach.
Really? I didn't feel like it answered the question at hand, namely what the windows were made out of, hence why it's a comment. Granted, the answer is almost certainly "Nobody knows", because nobody ever made reference to it, but even so, I've made no suggestions as to what they might be, only that they're definitely something that can survive in a 0-Pressure environment.
I'm pretty sure I've read this. Were the prisoners kept in a dungeon-type environment?
Were the captors humans or aliens? Likewise, was the protagonist human or alien?
*Has this ever been confirmed anywhere in canon or official sources* - Is there a reason why Caprica isn't included as canon and/or an official source?
There are two questions here: how did someone know how to poison Kosh and how did Dr. Kyle know how to treat it. Which question do you want us to answer?
By canon, you mean "in the comics"? Presumably the original incarnation (before any universe splits and reboots)? Because these are all "canon" - just different canons.
*but according to this question there could theoretically be more then one avatar born at a time.* where are you getting that? i've read the question and all the answers, and nothing remotely insinuates that.
Mystique has pretty good control of her appearance.  One could assume they aren't showing because she doesn't want them to show?
Dupe of [Does Gryffindor have a backup seeker?](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133617/does-gryffindor-have-a-backup-seeker) but there's no satisfactory answer to the *identity* of said Seeker. My instinct is that they fielded one less Chaser and had a substitute stand in for the missing player. Clearly they had a Seeker before Harry joined, just not a good one.
What is "permanently" in comics?
Do the Hogwarts staff **know** she spies? She's usually very quiet and hides inside a faucet. Not the sort of behavior that attracts attention to itself. Harry might be the first person she told about spying on boys.
Are we ruling out mythology/magic such as the Holy Grail?
Elixirs of youth go way, way back. How do you distinguish between mythical and stfnal elixirs?
Does suspended animation count?
Did it involve a radio?
If a human is stranded on a distant world which is populated with intelligent non-humans, does that count as being "alone on a planet"?
Any reason why Hagrid couldn't have been Ogg's assistant?
Haven't seen it yet but did the main character eat food hidden inside walls?
He's still feeling the after-effects of the Confundus Charm and consequently is confused, disorientated and weak - why do you say 'after-effects'? What reason is there to think that, as Dirk says, he isn't actually confunded, not formerly confunded? Also, why would a ministry run by death eaters remove a poor performer from the department tasked with eliminating dark wizards? Seems like they would want the Auror office undercut as much as possible no?
Whatever gave you the idea that the Ministry cares about competence in its staff? It was in very short supply at the top of the organisation.
@anemone Why not? Nothing stops Sauron from leaving his fortress, except perhaps bad memories of what happened the previous few times he had done so.
Do we have any evidence that snakes in the HP universe don't have eyelids? That "Anatomy of Boa Constrictors" thing seems to be referring to snakes in the real world.
you didn't watch the entire series I take it? ;)
Maybe because no one among the Westerosi has ever ventured that far?. Westeros is set in a medieval setting where people had Maps of the Known World, not complete World. Take a look at our own world, it was not until Age of Sail and Age of Discovery that we finally came to know about our own World. The Maps you see are drawn by the Westerosi for the Westerosi. The Info about most of Essos is from TWOIAF, which is written by a Maester.
Sorry. Maybe I shoulda used a smiley? What I mean is that *Captain Marvel Adventures* (Fawcett Publications, 10 cents) was my favorite comic book as a kid in the Golden Age, and I consider the DC version (which I've never read) to be a poor imitation.

Every captain in Starfleet received a briefing on Q; https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/133423/20774 Is that sufficient for you? I would imagine that given that there are thousands of ships on the fleet, that sort of info would leak to every major power with even the most cursory intelligence-gathering capability. ..
I can't find an existing question asking simply 'what is the chronological viewing order of the apes movie' - maybe the question just needs to be asked like that instead of the subjective request to determine which order is better?
Do you mean "When did they start building it" and "Where did the labour come from"? (Both of which are answerable by googling "Death Star" and clicking the first link, by the way, but LMGTFY links are frowned upon)
Wait - you're saying he _should_ have bitten her? Do people bite people often?!
Several important points here. 1. This probably doesn't need the [tag:doctor-who] tag. Although this might have been what inspired you to ask the question, it is not *about* Doctor Who. 2. You talk about changing gender, but do you mean sex, external sexual presentation, or gender? The Doctor probably is changing all three, but a transgender person who undergoes surgery is merely affirming their pre-existing gender, for example (and arguably thus changing only number two).
Shouldn't you know? ;)
I suppose the first question is: did Renly know who Cersei's children's real father was? If so, if he had a lust-fuelled motive for wanting to ditch Cersei, he'd *want* to believe this news, and such a disgrace would be a rare opportunity to dislodge the Lannisters and set up Renly's allies the Tyrells as the new power behind the throne.
In the middle of a fight? No.
I thought my answer to this one was reasonably solid, given the book quote. Is there anything else you'd want me to address before considering an acceptance?
By "Jedi Mind Tricks", are you only referring to when a person uses the Force to change somebody's decision? What about when somebody uses the Force to read somebody's secret thoughts. Vader and Palpatine did that a few times in novelizations of the movies and in canon novels.
Shouldn't Rey have two attempts, with one failed? She tried to persuade the guard to release her and he refused, then she tried again and it worked.
Huh? Are you asking whether he was using the Force to conceal his true looks? Because I'm pretty sure you can't do that, at least within the main canon.
Which channel was it on?
*But you’re Muggle-born, so someone **from the school** will have to come and explain to your parents* Why are you asking about Ministry officials?
Are you sure that is surprise on Yoda's face? When humans prepare theirs bodies for fighting (though fear or anger, mostly, but it can also be conscious), they start breathing deeper to increase oxygen intake, which benefits physical movement. His open mouth could be due to physically increasing his oxygen intake.
Oh goodness... this one covers a really wide net. Are you only interested in Salvatore's work? Only particular regions and/or narratives?
What do you mean by recorded history? Do you mean history that is still remembered circa 0 BBY? Or remembered by the Republic? Or simply written down at some point regardless of whether the records survived?
when the Y-Wings were making their run, is there any evidence the X-Wings even knew the TIES were in the trench? By the the time of the second run, Luke indeed said his group would cover for them, but apparently didn't get the chance. At that point, Luke, Wedge, and Biggs started their run, at which time they were they only fighters left
You're a rebel pilot in formation with your leader, Luke Skywalker. You enter the trench. You become aware, for whatever reason, that Vader and his goons are entering the trench. Now what? You and your other wingman exit the trench. Vader's goons also exit the trench to deal with you. Congratulations, you have now left Luke own his own with Darth Vader right behind him, with no way to defend himself. Luke gets shot down, the Death Star isn't destroyed, the galaxy is doomed.
Did the Y-Wings in the film have shields? I know the Fantasy Flight Games X-Wing game Y-Wings have them ;) but those Y-Wings in the film were shot to pieces fairly quickly with no indication of shields. Your scenario still falls apart because even if Vader's wingmen peel off to track the Y-Wing wingmen, Vader still stays on the leader and obliterates him in the trench
Why does that have to be a Star Wars bounty hunter and not just a medieval knight?
How does your question relate to the scenario? Are you simply using to establish a precedent for "best" of a race?
how do we know they didn't? In any case, not many characters really believed it existed in the first place (see Prof Binns comments in the book)
Do you remember if the stories were written by the same or different authors?  Were the stories related, i.e. set in the same future?  Or were they each in a different future?
It's not at all obvious to me what you mean by the term "spherical music" that you use twice. Can you perhaps elaborate a bit on that? Also, do you remember what platform you played the game on? Did you have a PC or Mac. If a PC, was the game for Windows or DOS. If Windows, do you remember which version of Windows you were using at the time? That might help narrow down the date range.
are you 100% certain the game starts in the Sol system?
@StefanH Several elements in your description make me think of [Ascendancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascendancy_(video_game)), which was around the same time period (1995) and the first I can think of with a 3D solar system map like Star Citizen.  Heavy on research and colonization.  Definitely has [spacey-sounding music](https://youtu.be/kMU5rhEZpkA?list=PLA07BEF3A42580696), and is a relatively unknown game these days.  However, it definitely wasn't the Sol system, and humans weren't even an option when [picking a species](http://www.b-sting.nl/ascendancy/species.html).
Could it be Imperium Galactica 2?
_Does_ she, really?

But that said, perhaps she was there to give Harry some love-potion-tainted chocolates, so that Ron would get poisoned and break up with Lavender? Or alternately, to tie into Malfoy's assassination attempts?
Clickbait much? ;)
Why wouldn't *rewinding the entire simulation* count as a change that would then introduce *even more glitches*?  Seems like a catch-22 situation, to me.
Do you remember the context? Was it in-universe, from the narrator and/or a character? Was it in one of his later exploratory essays? Was it a CT commentary? Was it out-of-universe, something like "I put it in evil stuff because it makes for a good story"?
So, the sea creatures had already captured some humans, then, and these humans were collaborating?
How did the main character get stuck on the spaceship such that he required rescuers? Were the human rescuers already in contact with the sea aliens at the time of the rescue? Do you have anything to add describing the aliens' names, bodies, personalities, or culture?
Why do we assume that the actors ages have anything to do with the characters ages?
*Because under their natural sun they would most likely age as humans do on Earth* Is there precedent of this regarding Kryptonites/Daxamites, or is this just an assumption? My knowledge of Superman lore is not very extensive.

does the book go into any details about 'paradoxes'? Where time travel is involved, it's generally a good idea to mess as little as possible with your own timeline -- travelling into your own recent past could be disastrous if you accidentally changed something relevant to your life.

Could it be [*The Last T'En*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1961322.The_Last_T_En) by Rowena Cory Daniells?
`However, I am asking how it would be proved, either with tangible evidence or by proclamation or by some other strategy I hadn't thought of.`, how does the linked answer not cover those since you don't think they are the same questions? "Proof" is always with evidence. Proclamations don't prove anything. Did Stannis' proclamation on bastardy of Joff, Tommen and Myrcella prove anything?
Maybe, they want the plans too? Tarkin did blow up the base. If they had no backup elsewhere, then the only plans left are the ones the Rebels stole.

Why does she have a reason to hide it?
I think you overthink it. Wasn't the main component of the device that enables one to step a potatoe? Isn't one author Terry Pratchett? I don't think that the book is meant to be taken seriously. Also if I remember correct, our earth was the only one with native "humans". All other humans on all other earths were steppers from our earth, right? So I don't think the story examines the quantum tree idea that every possible alternate reality is present on one of the earths. Also remember that its a chain of earths, not a tree. To map a tree to a chain seems not what they've done here.

It's opinion based because of the way the question is worded: "if there's anything I lose from" - emphasis on the "I" used several times (in the title and the bold text) - that is purely subjective. If the question is reframed as to the showrunners intentions, that would be a different matter. But as written, the question is absolutely opinion based because it is worded as being about something only you can ultimately answer. You may lose something, others may not, etc... "Do you *need* to know?" - I don't know - do you? I personally would want to, others won't care. It's subjective
What do you mean he stopped caring? Are you asking why he didn't make a horcrux for every murder?

In some sf starfighter game (forgot which, perhaps one from the battle tech universe?) missiles were fast running and could only change course slightly. When they missed the target. they weren't able to turn 180 degrees and come back. Torpedos on the other hand, were slower and were able to turn 180 degrees and attack again several time, until thy run out of fuel. They last much logner than missiles. Perhaps George Lucas had some simliliar idea. Or he thought just that it sounds cool.

Why do you say "pedant" and not "would-be humourist" (who would be well advised to keep his night job of lighting fireworks)? Gandalf's repartee doesn't seem very funny to *me*, but the book was written for *children*.

Wasn't The Hobbit originally for his kids? Having heard audio of Tolkien, i would have imagined that reading this to his young children in a gruff-ish voice, waggling of eyebrows included, would have raised a bit of a giggle among the young uns. No in depth analysis would have likely occurred.

I'm assuming that Tony Stark (who created not just Iron Man's armor, but the original version of the Guardsman armor, Jim Rhodes' War Machine armor, and Pepper Potts' Rescue armor. It tends to eventual fail the permanency test (because the armors can break down), and the "transferring power from someone/thing else". However, it was my first thought. Expanding slightly, *WHAT IF?* (1970s) #3 had Tony build armor for Giant-Man, Wasp, and others (Rick Jones, I think).

Are you sure the novel was from the 1980s?  The reason I ask is that there is an SF novel called Mother of Storms by John Barnes which matches pretty well to what you are describing. Including a scene in which people are in an RV trying to get to higher ground and mega-storms.  The only thing is that it is from 1994.  As Mooz indicates, however, this is a common trope so could easily be a different novel.  But link is here if this rings any bells or cover art might be familiar:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_of_Storms

Not to mention Burnham's little mutiny and getting Captain Georgiou killed on a poorly planned capture mission, making a martyr for the Klingon Empire (out of grief at Georgiou's death?)...that was a bad chain of decisions.
I don't think this is provable one way or the other, thus my close vote as primarily opinion based. As it is the most damaging spell we've ever seen Harry cast, it makes sense he would try it against the undead (because how would Avada Kedavra re-kill something? Better to try and rip them to shreds). As for trying it on Snape - the book does say that at the moment Harry cast it against Snape, Harry hated Snape as much as he hated Voldemort.

By "funny book", do you mean a book that is funny, or a graphic novel? I just ask because newspaper comic strips are often referred to as "the funny papers".
The humour in the Orc having a bunch of highly intelligent relatives has a Terry Pratchett/Discworld feel to it, but I can't think of a book that matches.

Was this a movie in a seat-back infotainment system or was it on someone's personal device? If it was the former, it might be listed on the airline's website/app or someone else might be flying that could look it up during their flight.
Battleship maybe?
So if he'd tested it properly it would have been an apocalypse of zombie mice instead? Might have made a more interesting story. What is a "10 read"?
So doing more animal tests wouldn't have helped, because the problem only showed up when they tested it on human subjects?

@rackandboneman Does it? I don't remember them saying that. An earlier episode (Equilibrium I think) established that there were 500 symbiots available per year, but something like 5000 initiates.
And another problem with your idea: how exactly do you think Harry would have been given the sword if he had the portrait? Dumbledore overhears Phineas talking about where they are; Dumbledore then instructs Severus to get the sword to him. Remember Severus is also in the dark about the Horcruxes. And maybe it's because Harry didn't feel it was his right to take the portrait or didn't think about it (He was sort of in shock and grieving!). And as for in book 7? He had no choice at that point did he? You also must remember they're still kids (even if they come of age they're still quite young).
Is the only SFF element that they may have been ghosts/she may have been a ghost?
Would different parts of the story showing each trait count?  Many stories have hard science at one point, but then leave them for almost philosophical arguments later.  Stranger in a Strange land starts with RAH's usual focus on hard science (when it's referred to, such as info on space voyages, and even Michael's abilities make reference to theoretical possibilities in physics) and transistions into a Philosophical pre-cursor to his World-as-a-Myth concept by the end of the book. (Soft SciFi in that it postulates existence being a matter of (and product of) belief, but has no evidence.)

Do you, by chance, know it's country of origin..? What is it's style..?
You're asking a question that cannot be answered by objective expertise. *"What does it actually mean?"* requires subjective interpretation of a creative work - there is possibly nothing that would get more opinion-based in the entire network.
Do you know that she was dressed as a specific character? Don't people go to this sort of event dressed as generic witches and wizards?
Time slows down when you go into the thing? Does that mean that you see somebody go into the thing, and he comes out a week later, and he says it only felt like a minute?
OK. It was a novel, and it was in English? And do you remember any more of the plot? Were there non-human intelligences involved? Was the "time machine" an invention or a natural phenomenon? Was there some particular project that the humans were working on in that institute? Were they in a war with aliens?
Are you asking in-universe where it is or what?
So more specifically, your question is whether it was based on a real-life location as opposed to one made out of whole cloth?

This question is a bit unclear what you are actually getting at. I recommend you retitle to something like "Does the medallion protect against saidin?" I would do it for you, but I have no read the books and don't know if it is an appropriate change for your question.

Would it not seem quite evident that the diorama was created after, and since Ego could change his form at will he would've been able to make it what he thought it might look like, then change it to something more accurate later? As for how he knew the word human, is it not entirely possible that was added later into the story, that he set out what it truly meant to be biological but since he was telling peter he made it human?
Why can't Maud and Susannah simply have opposite attitudes here? What you might view as insightful, Susannah might view as naïve. Or she might view Maud as refusing to take responsibility for her actions and those of her fellows, instead blaming Susannah etc.
Speed, maybe? Do we have any evidence in the movie of a planet capable of reshaping itself in a bunch of seconds?
I don't understand the premise of your question. Is there any problem this may solve? How does the answer to this question help you in any way? Have you done any research to finding the answer?

I think you're forgetting the vast standing army as well as all of the crews on the (tens of?) thousands of Minbari warships and all of the people in charge of training and outfitting them. For every front-line soldier you need at least 5-10 support staff to keep them fighting. In a hyper-advanced army, that ratio might be even higher; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth-to-tail_ratio

From the top of my head, I can think of multiple children’s books that start with the same premise and were published around the 2000s. Pity is, the only one I remember by name is [Dragon Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Rider_(novel)). Maybe you can say something more about the colour of the dragon, where in the real world it took place (US? UK?) and so on so that it is easier to identify.
Who says that a god can't die?

Based on your "criteria", Hermione is too dumb to be in Ravenclaw, not hardworking enough to be in Hufflepuff, and not cunning enough to be in Slytherin. Does that sound right?
_That_ would be some hell of a coincidence, no? Whereas, randomly finding a code-breaker who is 'good enough' to get the job done is well within the themes of the movie.

There was also a [D&D Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Computer_Fantasy_Game) done on a tiny hand-held console.. or, to be honest, it could easily be a local home-brew variation of Hunt-the-wumpus; many of us aspiring programmers made versions of it...

Yes, he did. He never actually touches the broom. Whether he is conscious of this ability as "not normal" and his other abilities is actually is the question. There is also another answer around here that brings up how he was holding the broom similar to a lightsaber at the end of that scene as well; kind of foreshadowing (similar to the ?director's? comments and such) that while the Skywalker family has been key to the Light side and the Light side was on its last leg, there are others out there that will become pivotal in the future and the Light side is by no means going away...
Do you count stories in which not just the personality but the whole person, body and soul, is yanked from the past to the future at the moment of death, and either replaced with a fake body (as in the Varley story mentioned in JRE's answer), or else returned to the past to die on schedule?

Two questions, then. The first is this: why is everyone so worried now about North Korea launching a nuclear weapon against Japan, South Korea, or the US? Surely the natural doctrine of MAD that is always in place by inviolable physical law would prohibit it?
The second is: What forces someone to retaliate when they’re attacked? There have been some rapid capitulations in conventional warfare, as well as countries that did not retaliate with attacks on civilian targets when invaded. What makes nuclear weapons special here?
Also, maybe you know something about the Indo-Pakistan War of 1999. Or perhaps the Yom Kippur War? And you can tell me again how a country with nuclear weapons is totally safe from invasion. ;)
Aberforth could cast a Patronus, which is an advanced spell, so that's certainly true. But otherwise he's portrayed as mediocre, in fact this question has  just made me realise how odd that is. Doge describes him as being not at all bookish or academically gifted and Albus once says (though possibly in jest and possibly even intending to maintain Aberforth's obscurity) that he's not entirely sure his brother can read! I wouldn't say that it's my impression that we see Aberforth was powerful?
DV 'cause the question is flawed. What you are asking why the Federation believes in its values, instead of giving up and taking advantage of it like everyone else.

Could the anthology be *[War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Worlds:_Global_Dispatches)*?  Its stories describe how the rest of the world dealt with H. G.

Some of the "training" is implied to happen offscreen, and the nature of that training changes after *In The Shadow of Z'ha'Dum* and Sheridan insists he's going to fight the Shadows at Z'ha'Dum.

It's probably summed up as getting him to think outside his boxes or step outside his comfort zones, but Sheridan was already a fair hand at that, so...

Transsexual or transgender?
There is a huge difference. Transsexual is changing your sex, transgender is changing your gender. Sex is determined by your genitals. Gender is how you feel. Brienne is definitely transgender, i.e., she feels more like a man than a woman. If she likes Renly, we can say she is a transsexual gay man. (Does it make sense to you?) Varys can be considered as transsexual, but it is hard to say 100%.
It's going to be difficult to answer, because a lot of the universes could coexist, and even in the clip shows they sometimes twist the context of the original clips into new storylines, turn something that was supernatural and imply it was aliens, for example.

Given that SW: Republic is a Legends comic, I think the answer on [How many Jedi use red lightsabers?](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/27070/5184) covers this. The new canon changes this with [the "bleeding" and corruption of the crystals](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/143240/5184)

Isn't this a basic premise of the movie?   It's even explicitly explained.
@Ginasius obviously I touched a nerve, I am not meaning to offend your ego and I did not mean to get under your skin to the point where you wrote 3 replies.  .  The edit I propose does no harm, maybe you should ask yourself why it bothers you?
Maybe they were designed to be used against light armored vehicules and personels, but not AT-AT?l
What about this story makes it scifi or fantasy, rather than just clinical research?
@thumbtackthief Would you be interested in evidence from the Fantastic Beasts movie, and do you mind spoilers for it?
What's special about this image? Did someone just put images of random characters together?
Could it be that those characters are notable because they are **cameos** played by famous actors/people? The Septon is played by Ian McShane, the wildling woman by Birgitte Hjort Sørensen, then there is Ed Sheeran, ... (possibile exception: the wight, but maybe he was motion-captured by someone famous too?)
Are you looking for the actual first story, as in the title? Because the question body seems to be asking "was the physics predicted by a SF story?" instead.
Shouldn't the research be done in the question? As opposed to asking questions like "Hey I noticed this thing, I know exactly how to answer it but I'm not interested in doing the work, can someone do the work for me?"
Maybe the original Total Recall Movie? Near the end Arnold enters some ancient cave an mars where ragged mutants are hiding. This could be your "red mine" and "maniacs from Mad Max". And later there are large pillars and machines:
what items do you mean land on the appropriate planet?
Are you asking about whether Loki fits the parameters of something established in a completely different work of fiction? Or are you simply asking whether the intent in the Marvel universe is that Loki can't fight fate?
I wanted to be certain. :) Sometimes, when people use specific terms, they want specific interpretations. Just to clarify, are you asking whether it was inevitable, or whether there is evidence that someone made it inevitable by setting up the situation so no matter what Loki did, it would end as it did? I've seen the latter described as a "Destiny Trap" as well, I think in Stross's "Laundry Files" books.
My only real knowledge of this topic stems from the MCU, but wikis seem to indicate that a Sorcerer Supreme is only a title and that it can change at any time... also that the Vishanti are the primary determinant factor to who the current SS is. It also looks like it is not a requirement that the current/new SS is imbued with additional abilities automatically when afforded the title and it is merely based upon who in the realm is the most gifted/knowledgeable in the mystic arts and their ideals(?)... shouldn't someone's limitation on abilities be the current spells they know, not their title?
Good description so far. Do you remember any element that makes this sci-fi or fantasy genre, such as spaceships or monsters? Are there any illustrations, and if so, what style?
Seems like the sandplankton is the weak link here.  It's composed *at least in part* of larval sandworms, therefore, logically, it's part *something else* as well.  The entire planet is a desert and described as very hot, so Arrakis obviously absorbs energy from the sun, the same as Earth, despite the lack of plants or water - arguably even better since it seems to have much more heat, being all desert.  Perhaps there's an undiscovered (thus undescribed) means of gathering solar power further south, beyond even the furthest Fremen sietches?  (I have no sources for this, it's pure speculation.)
privacy laws, anyone?

Aw man... I'm slacking. Can you also go to https://scifi.stackexchange.com/tags/story-identification/info and look at those questions? Answering them, and editing said answers into your question, will help us a great deal. Like, when did you read this? What country? Do you remember about how long it was? Paperback? Hardback? Any details about the cover?
Are you looking for real world physics to explain fictional ones? If so, this question is likely off-topic. If not, please clarify your question.
They marooned a group of people on an **undiscovered** island? How was that possible? Wouldn't somebody have to discover it before they could do that?
Here's the version of this old joke that I heard 50 or 60 years ago: A man goes on an arduous pilgrimage to consult an all-knowing sage who would respond to one question. On finding the sage, the man asks him, "What is the best question that I can ask, and what is the best answer that can be given?" The sage replies, "The best question that can be asked is the one you have just asked, and the best answer that can be given is the one I am giving you." Apparently somebody took this old story and dressed it up with aliens.
Considering that they let some kid fly one of the like, nine x-wings they had in their darkest hour, they must be a little short on pilots. So they buy the best single-seater fighter available. [Xwing](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/T-65_X-wing_starfighter): 4 guns, a "complement of proton torpedoes", shields, hyperdive, plus an astronomic droid slot. TIE fighter: 2 guns (full stop). X-Wings don't seem much of a threat against what now?
Why do people travel in their own, small, uncomfortable car when they could as well take the bus, or better yet train or plane? Easy: Independence and cost.
@bdecaf Practicality? In most cases, the extra seat is not needed. The X-Wing is readily available, another ship might not be. The pilot is in most cases very familiar with the X-Wing. If you have a smart with 2 seats and are used to driving it, why take a 4 seater SUV you are unfamiliar with? just because it has two more seats you do not need anyways?
I am not sure what point you are making, the lighthearted humor of my comment seems to have eluded you, and I assure you lighthearted humor was the entirety of the intent. Your supposition seems baseless,  and is certainly fallacious. (By the bye... was the 400 foot long dragons in Doc Smith's Lensmen series? That's ringing vague bells from several decades back...)
I think we need to clarify what you mean by "original relationship."  Certainly the origins of each are independent, as Zabeus says.  Are you asking for the first known instance of a story that provides a relationship between them, and if so what that relationship was?  Are you asking for the first known instance of a relationship similar to the one you describe?

Is it possible (having not seen the movie yet... I'm slow) that he's referring to the Old Gods of the First World from the comics, which (supposedly) died out long before even Darkseid existed?  Darkseid is a New God, named in relation to that particular set of Old Gods.  The destruction of the Old Gods is what actually caused the creation of Earth's pantheons (as well as that of other planets).  The destruction of their world created the twin planets of Apokalypse and New Genesis, the inhabitants of which would become the New Gods over time.

interesting question - assuming you are meaning books as well - even though the examples given in the question are film? In book 4, we are shown Molly Weasly giving Amos Diggory's head a bite to eat through their fireplace and no mention of fire color changing to green
Are you asking specifically about the "laser" part, or also about the "turbo-" part? The "turbo-" part is probably from things like "turboprop," where it originally referred to a jet turbine (combined with a propeller) and then came to mean "mega-," "super-fast-," or "awesome."

I figure the communication system *somehow does know* who the call is going to before he says "Riker," and plays the audio on Riker's end in real-time.  Sort of like how all the automated doors on the Enterprise *somehow know* if a person approaching the door intends to walk through immediately **or** stop right beside the door for a moment and give a parting quip before walking through.  **The door doesn't open until the person is actually going through.**  Isn't it amazing what they can do with machine learning?!

Is the question specific to Han, or is it about murder in general? AFAIK, Tatooine wasn't under Imperial rule at the time of Greedo's passing, so Han's shot might not have legally counted as "murder" on the Hutt-dominated planet. As for the Empire itself, I'm pretty sure murder was a thing, but I don't have a quote/reference handy for that.
Is your question about what Indians (for example) **IN** the Harry Potter universe would call muggles or how it is translated into Hindi? Some answers seem to assume the former question, while others answer the latter. You might want to clarify this in the question.
Why not all be females?
Your comment makes about as much sense as your comment. Everything you point out suggests there all female, and then you ask "Why are they all female", to which I ask, "Why can't they be all female?", which can also be read "Why does there need to be any reasoning to them being all female?" besides "Because the were".
Stamps. Socks. Drills. Common sense and logic?
I dont know much about Potterverse but I think it depends on what you consider an ability and "naturally better at." I am curious if the unique/heightened abilities Muggles possess might be the things we take for granted; more so because the wizarding world has surpassed them in some way. I would expect: better immune systems given the wizards better medicine and healing, stronger muscles given we move furniture the hard way, etc. Of course everything would be naturally superior before any magical enhancements. Could we also say ingenuity? Do wizards invent as often? ...Can a wizard moonwalk?

I would call it research if it was anything but pure speculation. You wouldn't call "I don't know how gravity works, but it might be an invisible ghost pulling us down" research either?

Also who's to say the tracks aren't used by other trains? Not everyone is a thief too (though I live near a decommissioned line and those tracks disappeared quickly).
Is there any reason to believe that someone would come along and steal a well kept track? I assume the MoM keeps it refurbished, clean and up-to-scratch. Secondly, do you really think  they'd have built the train line through someone's farm? Finally, you're witnessing a classic example of "fans digging deeper than they should to solve problems that really aren't there". The train line also doesn't need to be hidden, merely the train does.
Who said the line was decommissioned? Seems like it's used at least once annually. The PM might've known abut the line and ensured it was listed as a active line.

I also remember a Young Adult  clone story I read probably around 1993 in the US, probably published by Scholastic. I remember the clone reporting "funny feeling" and the main character and his best friend realized the clone had to use the bathroom for the first time. Does that ring a bell? It might not be a match, since I remember a lot of difficulty with the clone's communication skills while learning English, which might rule out telepathy.
Actually, this questioin makes me wonder why a certain Headmaster did not use his OP wand to fix said wands. I mean, the elder wand was able to repair Harry's broken-by-dark-magic-hit wand, surely it could have fixed Ron's. Non-competition agreement with Ollivander's? ahah

This sounds like three separate questions, about three separate characters' decisions.

Welcome to SFF! Could you take a look at [this guide](https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9335/how-to-ask-a-good-story-id-question/9337#9337) and [edit] in anything else you may remember?
Can methane provide enough energy to power a ship into orbit?  I've seen the new Lost in Space and liked it, but the first time they mentioned methane I thought that it couldn't be right.  Maybe methane is used as a catalyst for a more powerful source of energy.  I don't remember them mentioning anything like it in the show though.
So I feel I should preface by saying that they were really trying to put a "spin of science" on the entire situation. The queen had a disease that she was immune to and all the other people were not. So, whatever the reason it should be logical and possible. That said, we don't know for sure. They don't explain more than we see. We need more information (book or sequel) to know why... However, who says he was really dead when he laid there for those few minutes? Maybe he was in a sort of catatonic state as the infection took hold...
Are you asking for evidence solely surrounding the X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie or will evidence from the comics or animated series work as well?
@Adamant - Not really. How is a super-intelligent villain supposed to use their powers if not by making things?
The quoted derivation makes no sense. In traditional lore a banshee merely fortells death, and does not cause it. What would a dark banshee be? How would it go against the laws of magic? Are there even any laws of magic in Celtic folklore?
Clearly "Where did  word come from?" and "Did author create word?" are essentially asking the same thing.
Tangent - I see to recall that the prefix "NX" was for prototype or experimental ships. Am I hallucinating?
Nowhere in the books I got the impression that Hermione has eidetic/photographic memory. So yeah, why wouldn't she read up? the fact that she knows the legend is in there means she recalls some bit, but not details. That is quite normal.
You realise what may be "obvious" from an out-of-universe perspective may not necessarily be the case from an in-universe perspective, right? This is a children's film. It was likely very intentional that the googles be "obvious" otherwise the children would just be left muddled, however from an in-universe perspective it's supposed to be as subtle as the aliens tapping your brain waves. This does _not_ make it a plot hole, as the logic of the plot flows _perfectly_ with this addition.
Because they are Incredible?
So being a maths genius means you have excellent common sense? The two are not related, being clever in one area doesn't make you clever everywhere. Visa versa being not so clever somewhere doesn't mean you are not so clever everywhere.
If the Voyager writers were not influenced by the whole of the TNG cannon, wouldn't that represent a huge failure to understand the universe they're writing about?
Does the [Lustiges Taschenbuch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustiges_Taschenbuch) count as canon? The very old stories (~1970) had some meetings between the characters.
Didn’t he move a broom with the Force?
Were the ships made by aliens? Does the name [*Heechee*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heechee) ring a bell?
So they could all arrive at once, in the same place, for the minimum amount of effort? q.v. *"Why do the goa'uld even bother with stargates...."*
Do you happen to know the episode number? I'm going to look into this.
May have been "The Thing from Another World", sometimes referred to as "The Thing", a 1951 American black-and-white science fiction-horror based on the novella "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell?
Is it possible there's a mistake in this line of your quote: *Juliet had put on her best cutesy voice for the security guide.*? My book has "**tour** guide" – do you have a different version, or did you perhaps type the wrong word?
Where does that dialog say pilots? It's talking about pod racers. Humans make poor pod racers. That doesn't mean they're poor spaceship pilots.
Does the AI have to have a physical body? I'm going to guess yes?
So not *The Sun in Her Eyes* by Paige Toon? "You were right all along. I swear I didn't know she fancied me. I couldn't see it."
If IMDb says that "the actor" was indeed _the actor_, do you have any reason to believe that he isn't the actor? I'm also unsure how stating that an actor was a character in a film is a spoiler?
I’m not quite sure what your question is? The theme of people calling other people by names other than their preferred names?
Having a fully armed and operational battle station isn't a a force power? Darn it, now how will it get my own Death Star?
Aren't "recreation rooms" usually in the basement?
@TheLethalCarrot I don't think there *is* a "how" to begin with. It's like asking "Why did the chicken want to get to the other side?"
Can you remember the nickname of the author? It might help with identifying the story.
**Potential spoilers** Did this end with the humans in the *simulation* hacking into 3D printers in the *real world*, printing bodies for themselves, downloading their consciousnesses into them, and invading the *real world*? Also the simulation was made by sentient beings in a reality where sentient life naturally evolves a get-along, peaceful sort of trait, and they simulated us to see what would happen if sentient life could evolve without that, and were prone to fighting/war.
Just to clarify were the "non humans" still humanoid? Also were these novel length books, short stories, etc.?
The second story sounds like van Vogt's "Juggernaut". Are you *sure* you read them both in the same anthology?
Given the number of Spider-Man stories seen in the two runs of *What If?* (not to mention the event-oriented and "one-shot" runs in more recent times), it's unlikely. In many of those stires, there's no difference to Spider-Man's costume, or minimal differences. For instance: from the very firdt *What If*, there's the Spider-Man who became a member of the Fantastic Four at the start of his career - his costume would have a 4 or a 5 in the middle of the spider on his chest. Few of the "What If" variations even have that much to distinguish them.
Do you have any sources for the idea that Galactic Basic is their *sole language*?  Just because it's the only language we see them speak (particularly when they're speaking to outsiders like the Jedi) doesn't mean it's the only language they ever use.
Do all sorts of saints count as super heroes? They performed miracles and many wore capes as it was the fashion of that time. For example, Saint Nicholas is often depicted wearing a cape and Santa Clause clearly is a super hero
Would Hercules’ lion pelt count?
Can you please clarify why you think God *modified* pi rather than just starting the universe with that particular value of pi? Or is that what you mean by *"Math itself must precede both the universe and anything or anyone that created it."*?
Is there anything distinctly SciFi or Fantasy in the story?
Any of [these](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/9556.Forget_Meow_Talking_Cats_in_Fiction_) ring a bell? Also [this list](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/9556.Forget_Meow_Talking_Cats_in_Fiction_) though it doesn't specify if the cats are talking (link in French)
Is there any good reason to assume that they aren't set when they appear to be set, during the winter and spring?
In Book2, JKR conrrived a situation where they were left without broomsticks or wands (Ron's wand was broken, Harry's was taken by Tom Riddle, Hermione's was taken by Lockhart), plus they were second-years. In Book7, none of that applies. How did they get out? Probably the same way Slytherin, the Gaunts, Tom Riddle, the basilisk, and Ginny (presumably she entered the Chamber at some point while under the influence of the diary to let the basilisk out) did. It was the Chamber of Secrets, not the Chamber of No Way Out.
So the goddess is named "She"?
The final question, as is seems quite subjective, "best examples" by what measure? Which I though were the coolest? Which Billybob thought was the coolest? Or what?
Interesting question. Prince Phillip is titled Prince, although he's the husband to the Queen. My knowledge of monarchies is dreadful so I can't tell you of any other counter or supporting examples, but given ASOIAF is said to be "based on" the War of the Roses, this might be what GRRM/D&D had in mind. Just one question, which possibility is "yes" in your final paragraph?
Mild relief of megalomania?
Was Dumbledore Secret Keeper? Maybe he put Hagrid in the loop when he sent him to retrieve Harry. I don't remember if that implies going to the house first.
[Boids](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Boid) don't appear to be actively hostile. Does that count?
If gameplay is included, then he can run indefinitely. In particular, I remember a blue spheres level (probably played it on Mega Collection) where you could go around the checkered sphere in a straight line without needing to turn or jump (a level with the same principal can be found [here](https://bsgen-old.neocities.org/?act=onelevel&val=66249526) I think). Thus leaving the game alone on such a stage would allow Sonic to run forever. I'm sure there are other games where something similar happens but that's what came to my mind.
@JBH Please accept that is confusing to me. The question itself isn't, but the title of the question is. If you were standing in a car park, you wouldn't ask "what's the leftmost car to the left of that yellow one?" There's either ambiguity (there are several cars that are equally far to the left) or there isn't. Mentioning the yellow car doesn't change that at all...
Does Slughorn's conversation with him count? "*‘Merlin’s beard, Tom!’ yelped Slughorn. ‘Seven! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case … bad enough to divide the soul … but to rip it into seven pieces …’*"
No prob. Welcome to [fantasy.se]! Do you by any chance know [what Gabriel's bracelets signify?](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/91823/19561)
Is there any good indication to show that [Operation Recolonize](http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Operation_Recolonize) was intended to be a profit-making venture? At that point, the aim seems to be the survival of the species.
He doesn't know, but Dumbledore gave him some reason to go back to the Dursleys' each summer, didn't he? (can't remember what it was) So maybe Voldemort expanded a bit on this info - he knew how much Dumbledore believed in the power of love (cf the memory of him asking for the DADA job). Then again, that would mean him _recognizing_ such magic exists and is effective - not too much his type.
*Those things are iconic, and if they weren't in there, people would be upset, myself included. We are in this Ghost in the Shell world. Everything is cables. And early on, people were like, 'Why are there cables in everything?' Well, it is Ghost in the Shell, and if there were no cables, it wouldn't be Ghost in the Shell, so I am going to defer to the style of Ghost in the Shell and put cables in everything.* - https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/538qnn/ghost-in-the-shell-director-rupert-sanders
Does Joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat count? That seems to be a pretty old one!
As I recall, King David's son (Absalom?) was done in when his very long hair was caught in a tree. Not quite a cape, but close....
I'm sure you should have remembered and mentioned this, but he didn't have a set of lobster claws attached to his hips?
Is this question about H. G. Wells' _The Time Machines_ and Stephen Baxter's _The Time Ships_? (Just trying to clarify) Also can you remove the `[SPOILERS]` part in the title?
**You could argue that it had always been Voldemort's intention to take Lucius' wand, since he resents Lucius for his failure at bringing him the prophecy at the end of Order of the Phoenix, and that nothing would have changed his mind.** Absolutely that was the case. He mocked the Malfoy family throughout that meeting didn't he? And yes your own wand is best - and in the case of Bella's wand it's Unyielding so even more a reason for Voldemort to not have it. And I cringe at the word 'fangirl' ... that's so not Bellatrix.
Why *would* he ever have had butterbeer before? No really, it's a good question but it just seems like there weren't many parties in the common room before PoA and while there may have been some opportunities for them, that doesn't seem too suspicious. No need to celebrate every Quidditch match win, although there *could* have been such a celebration of the glorious defeat of Slytherin in PS, but Harry was in Hagrid's hut then if there was one, although it doesn't seem like there was one, but it's not *that* odd. There weren't any other house-specific events like Harry being made champion.
What is your actual question? You want to know what each thing in the little boxes mean?
Do you remember what year you read this? Or a rough decade/time period?
Why wouldn't they use the traditional methods (stars, landmarks, lat/long, maps, etc.)?  Are you asking because Westerosi aren't as good at sailing as, say Ironborn, so maybe they don't technically know how to do that?
Also I think somewhere in the books it is mentioned that packs can't join, they would attack each other. I think Moiraine says it at some point in the 3rd book?
Is your hart set on that answer for that bounty? If I were to recount the various dates and changes Tolkien went through during his writing of the various versions of the Hobbit, would it possibly contend with that answer. (If not I’ll write it anyways, just when I have more time.)
What part of "It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet..." are people not understanding?
Welcome to [scifi.se]! You have a really good start here but can you take a look at [this guide](https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/9337/58193) to see if there is anything else you can [edit] in? For example, were there any particularly memorable plot points of one of the stories?
Isn't Coulson **famously** dead after Loki stabbed him?
I'd like to point out that not every scene is supposed to be an allegory of christianity but an imagination about how the existence of the Christ would impact a fantasy world: "In reality however he is an invention giving and imaginary answer to the question What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours? This is not an allegory at all" Lewis
The Joker was a violent SOB and may have killed lots of kids parents?
So you're looking for the first example or a relatively primitive people using magic that, unbeknownst to them, is based on advanced technology? Something like angels of the Samaria series by Sharon Shinn, although I doubt that is the first example.
Off to a good start with some good details, but if you haven't already, could I recommend you take a look at [this guide](https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/9337/68872) and see if you can [edit] in any more details. Such as how long ago a few years was, anything about the characters, maybe what the cover of the book looked like?
@Rhys - In my opinion, asking about "the first work of fiction" is not the best way of asking the question. I would rather ask about the *inspiration*, which is probably what you really want to know. For instance, "What is the origin of the idea of wands with special cores?," with (at least) the addition of the [tag:inspiration] tag. That wouldn't invalidate any of the existing answers, and in fact would actually render the most-upvoted one valid.
I forget, is she surprised by the existence or surprised by the extinction?
Five "dollar" bill?
**five dollar bill** So..basically it's Hogwarts in the US, Canada or Australia (maybe there are other nations with dollars but those are the ones I'm aware of)? That's at the very least ridiculous. And why would a house elf have money? Okay it's fan fiction so that might explain it but ask yourself this: **what kind of fan of HP** would put Hogwarts in a place that uses dollars (and why would an elf use Muggle money anyway)?
Have you tried staying still in a room before? Many of my friends didn't even notice me, despite clearly looking in my direction. The fact that he didn't appear on the camera might be to further emphasize that.
@Albin Forgot you posted this... I meant to pull up the episode online to check it out... have you tried sound hound or anything by any chance or is there other sound effects drowning out that opportunity?
Would an answer using primarily sources from the _History of Middle-earth_ be acceptable? Unfortunately, I think it's the only way I can think of answering this question.
I'm trying to decide if this is a great question or not... wait for him to do what? They'd already met at Bespin and Luke had flat our rejected him. He didn't get back in touch, Luke reached out to him? He wasn't tracking him in RotJ the same way he was in ESB
@QuestionAuthority - I was wondering, are you a native English speaker?  Or perhaps (lucky you !!) you are a younger person.   **The phrase "marked as" is a slightly old-fashioned English phrase simply meaning "regarded as" or "thought of".**  For example I might say "I marked him as a cool dude" or "I marked Steven as a great driver."  That's all it is.  This question should really be moved to https://ell.stackexchange.com
*Rey knelt beside the mysterious droid. “Where’d you come from?”
Spares? Where we're going, we don't need spares.

Is this just about the MCU and DCU or about all of their comic properties as well?
That was a full-fledged film? Not an animated series?
@Seamusthedog alright, was thinking of [_Little Vampire_](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=petit+vampire) but it's not that known, and a series (and probably not translated). Still worth putting it somewhere in a "vampires in space" question... The series is awful, though.
Of course, Vernon Dursley does as well ? could you remind me? I don't remember seeing him smoke
You're basing this question off a question you asked 2 minutes ago, which has no answers? [Smoking in general is quite taboo in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_in_the_United_Kingdom), it's very likely this has worked it's way into JKRs writing.
I'm not sure how that says smoking is rare..?
It's been a long time since my last re-read, but don't we also learn that the spell stuck in Rincewind's head is overly aggressive and basically forces out other spells? If so, it's possible his way of seeing the learning of magic is very peculiar to his own circumstance and doesn't generally apply.
Is this specifically a *speculative fiction* trope? It seems like it's about something in fiction in general.
But is it on topic? If it's not about science fiction and fantasy, but occasionally shows up there and elsewhere, it's not really about SF, is it? We wouldn't field questions about why the first girl or boy gets their partner, even if it shows up in paranormal YA a lot. Or about the origin of the wise, elderly mentor figure, or the comical stereotyped foreigner.
Do you remember how long ago a long time ago is? Was it new then? Do you know anything else about this story? Any other plot elements, character descriptions, the outcome of the story? And if this is a short story can you add the `[short-stories]` tag? It helps catalogue questions.
incredible seems a bit opinion-based; would you have a clearer definition for it? :)
What kind of answer, exactly, are you expecting?
You have a good start here but did you watch anything else of this to know any other plot points you can [edit] in? Do you know the main character, what did they look like?
Any small detail you can add would help, like do you remember any other details of other scenes even if not so clearly? Do you remember the over all plot?
just have to ask - it's not any of the *other* dome-city stories listed in the question?
Although there's some great description here, this question would still be improved by going through the checklists here; [How to ask a good story-ID question?](https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9335/how-to-ask-a-good-story-id-question)
By "laws of magic" do you mean the Statute of Secrecy? The Ministry doesn't go against uncontrolled magic by kids if that's what you mean - otherwise a bunch of Muggleborns would be at Azkaban from the age of 7.
I remain unclear on what "laws of magic" you think that this breaks? On numerous occasions we see things getting disappeared and then reappearing.
but is she actually 'evil'? She has no love for the Dark Arts. imo - she's not evil. But, she is profoundly terrible in that she is strictly conservative and willing to go to great lengths to impose her moral worldview on others. In fact, FuzzyBoot's answer from JKR seems to validate that Umbridge isn't considered "evil" by the author, but still awful
Is there a definition of  "pure-blood"somewhere in the books?
Given that both questions have the same answer (as of now), this sounds a bit like a duplicate of [What Percentage Makes Someone a Half-blood?](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/10000/98028)

The question reminds me of a story but I cannot find it. If it is the same one, humans had previously been space conquers and the void is caused by all their outposts/colonies having been destroyed when the other races rose against them.  At one time the humans had genetically modified a rebel race to be born with no left arm which reminded the human character of Caesar's punishments in Gaul.  Does this ring any bells?

Any chance this might be a series instead of a single book? Long shot, and doesn’t fit perfectly with your description, but this reminds me of Sisi from the 2nd and 3rd books of the [Wind on Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_on_Fire) trilogy.

Leaving the orbit thing aside (which isn't necessarily related to physical strength which seems to be what you're aiming at), both Pidgey and Tyrogue are shorter than one meter (more or less).

This seems like a "Star Wars vs Star Trek" type question.  Evangelion and Pacific Rim are different universes with different handwaviums to make their giant bipedal mecha actually work.  IRL, **none** of these things would pan out like they do in the movies/anime.  Is there anything in the EVA series to suggest fully mechanical mecha are even possible?  (I don't remember any discussion along those lines, but it has been a long time.)
One question: How technologically advanced were the giant space rabbits when the galactic federation decided to make contact with them? For instance, did they already have electric lights and radio sets? Or were they back in the pre-gunpowder Medieval period, or even earlier? Or what?
I spent hours googling the crap out of this and came up with nothing. Sounds like a fascinating story, I'd love to read it. Can you remember any more details like the anthology it was published in?
What source material would you consider acceptable as references for an answer? Texts only written by Tolkein during his lifetime? The broader body of posthumous work discussed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_inspired_by_J._R._R._Tolkien (including the well-known films and games)? Fan fiction?
Do you remember the condition of the book? Was it printed much older, or around that time? Maybe it was part of a collection of short stories? Where did you read it/ how old were you? Where did you find the book?
Just to check, you do remember that goblins and elves have their own magic, right? If so do you mean them able to do "human" magic? Especially, wand usage?
Then [How Human do you need to be in order to be allowed to use a wand?](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/9792/98028) will be closely related. (I don't remember when the law was passed, but "No non-human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand." )

Haven't read this - can the other animals also talk? I see the little one on the bedpost is talking, but Deacon's voice uses black word balloons, implying something about the sound of the voice. From this one panel, I'd be inclined to say the prosthesis is where his voice is coming from.
Have you ever tried just walking through a forest? It's pretty bothersome. I'm not saying this is the reason, the thing is j r doesn't really care if it fits and is big enough, the books were written before google maps and so on, but really, how is someone just walking through a forest in the middle of nowhere? The government knows about magic, so it's semi believable that there is no official business there of any kind. The number of random people in the woods is so small ...
Ursula K. Le Guin's _"A wizard of Earthsea"_? The _true name_ hint fits, and the _wall_ too, but I remember no wolf ...

Is the tour haunted or are the segways haunted?
the rebirthing process was an elaborate spell to begin with, requiring more than just a single element of enemy blood. Since you'll need an enemy's blood anyway, and this *particular* enemy's blood will not only do the initial job, but give you extra protection against him (to prevent the same unfortunate experience of book 1) and you are egotistically confident that your plan to capture said enemy's blood will work, why not stick with that plan? Also - going with your idea would leave Wormtail w/ no hands :D
But how did Odin get to the Norway? Or did Dr. Strange just, visited him there.

What part of "Do what you must to protect yourself." is unclear?

That doesn't seems to prove that "Voldemort was controlling all the Imperius'd". Remember that he wasn't the only one to die this day. What if some of them were controlled by Bellatrix? Also the Malfoys "changed side" on last minute. They would have free their "prisoners" if they had some. I don't have anything canon to back up my claims though
There are literally hundreds of stories where a lone hero (or small team of heroes) goes up against overwhelming odds and somehow manages to win in the end.  Including cases where the opposing army has tanks, planes, giant robots and other "hard targets."  Is there a particular reason why this example is more difficult to believe than usual?
“Then he discovers that he is in the lab which his mentor while they were working on isolating the god factor gene” I think there is a bit missing from the middle of that sentence. And how do you mean that he discovers that he is in a lab he presumably used to work in? Was this hidden from him in some way? And is the idea that reality has been restabilized but questioning if it should go on, or that the restabilization is possible but should it be? Sorry, just trying to get some clarifications.

Not sure I am understanding your question correctly - do you want to know a list of these failed ejections? or What a failed ejection is?

Out of interest, why is a `laws-of-magic` tag needed? I'm not sure how it benefits this post in any way... I have removed it as it's also a far to generic name that would conflate with other magical fantasy stories.
Maybe I’m just not understanding your question, then.  Are you asking why Uriel didn’t save Stan, or are you asking if HWWB has free will, or something else?  It’s a bit of a jumble right now between what you have in the title, vs the question body, va your comment responses.

Perhaps the most important - when would this have been published? Also: were the "dragon magicians" explicitly called "dragon magicians" or is it your wording?
Other "wording" question, as Google yields nothing so far: were stuff like (recessive) alleles, genomes, named so? (seems unusual for a fantasy book)
Isn't that what you thought about "Medusa's Daughter" as well?
Still got to ask, any idea of the years you're the most likely to have read it? (I know you mentioned Barks and Don Rosa, bu there are so many Donald Duck writers...) Also, that was in English, right? (though I'd guess so, with you mentioning the two above)

@the-profile-that-was-promised I've only just noticed that another user added the GoT tag. Are you fine with asking about both canons or do you want to restrict it to just ASOIAF?

How long ago did you read the book? Your question indicates you think it may have been written in the early 1980s, but the well-upvoted answer below is for a book written in 2003. If you read it in the 1980s or 1990s, that answer can't possibly be correct.
What about the bible and the story of the tower of babel? Wouldn't the sucseasfull application of thier goal be a space elevator?
What about this story is science fictional or fantastic?  So far it sounds like a fairly conventional political thriller.

@NJohnny Have you checked all the literature entries for TV Tropes' [Lightspeed Leapfrog](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightspeedLeapfrog)?  Lists 20 or so books that use the basic idea.
Think about it. If they truly had a way do you think they wouldn't have known about the Portkey? They were instead shocked when Harry came out with the body of Cedric. And as @TheLethalCarrot points out Cedric was dead. Complain about it all you want but life isn't fair and the tournament in question can hardly be considered 'fair' or 'safe'. There is a reason they had cancelled it for so many years, after all.
@Alex I cannot believe you suggest that *Harry* would actually kill anyone. Not only is that ignoring his history (look at how it affects him when he sees the Unforgivable Curses! You think he'd be willing to kill? Really?) but it would almost certainly offend Rowling too. Just like the theory that Dumbledore might have created a Horcrux. The idea that Harry would kill anyone... Even Fudge didn't go to that extent. Nor did the Ministry.
@Alex Clearly it's not about what's safe. There's a reason the contest had been stopped for many many years. You know - something to do with deaths? And you say you didn't suggest Harry killed Cedric? What would this imply to anyone **Perhaps Cedric really won and Harry just killed him?** I wonder? Even if you weren't implying that it's the only logical conclusion that you were suggesting it. None of them would have ever thought Harry would kill yet you ask directly what I quoted - and asking '..and Harry just killed him?' is not suggesting Harry killed him? Interesting use of English I admit.
@Alex And that context you provide is also relevant to my point - and my point stands the same regardless. They would not suspect Harry under any circumstances esp at that point. Of all the spells for *Harry* to use... That's just asinine. He also was very very traumatised and you could tell he had been seriously injured. Yet they would have any suspicion? Sorry but the fact remains (1) I was using that context; (2) it's still wrong to suggest that they might suspect it. Not a chance and it would insult Rowling too for sure just as it did the theory that Dumbledore made a Horcrux.
@Alex Maybe so but it's preposterous to even consider that Harry of all people would have done that! He probably couldn't have performed the spell at all even if he tried. Remember he couldn't even cast Crucio in the next book and Miss Bella taunts him about that; only in book 7 does he note that he understands what she meant. Finally think of his history! Of all people you actually think they would consider that? That's just absolutely ridiculous. And what do you want to do, give the winner status to the dead participant? That's also rather silly don't you think?
@Alex Okay fine make them 'a winner' but to pay a dead person? Really? That's preposterous. But let's say that it's more than valid. The reality is the Ministry of Magic is corrupt. I think Rowling even likened it to Chamberlain (though I don't think that's the best analogy it's fair enough). And as for reader's reaction versus character? Funny how I didn't have any problem with it nor would I have. Yes I think of these things. Why would I think it any different? I believe I already noted how it affected Harry terribly to see the Killing Curse on the spider? That says plenty.

What makes you think authors analysed what electricity exactly  does to humans? I think there's plenty of reasons to think otherwise.
The phantom smell seems like the experience that some brain surgery patients report when parts of their brains are stimulated with electricity. Was this character being optimized the whole time to believe that he was not actually optimized?
_"if he is allowed to give students the passwords then why couldn't he just tell Neville the password when he forgot it?"_ One guess, **Polyjuice**. I don't think portraits could tell the difference, and it's silly to give the passwords who could be Polyjuiced to begin with, but still. Face recognition in a wizarding world is not the best idea.
This does appear to be a duplicate. The title question here is _"How could Sir Cadogan give Neville the passwords?"_ which can be reworded to _"How could Sir Cadogan distribute the passwords to Neville?"_. We close specific questions to general questions. It's just in this case the specific question inspired the general question but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be closed.
Which specific episodes did you have objections to? I've been looking through the [Lurker's Guide](http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/eplist.html), which has some of the producer's own replies to fan comments; he may address this very issue if I can find the right episode.

About the original language - you're not sure what it was, but could it be Hindi as well? Or was it definitely not made in India?
What about this jungle society film was science fiction or fantastical? Was the "god" a literal entity in it?
You mean how are the magic faces that magically transform the wearers features into an exact match of the original owner and (in the books) magically send the wearers psychic images of the original owners' demise prevented from mundane decay?  No idea.
Assuming this isn't something that will be covered in an upcoming book, you could improve this question by making it a bit more focused.  There may be many "possible" answers, depending strongly on what various people might consider "possible."  You should try to constrain this somewhat by more concretely setting the parameters of your question; broadly speaking what is and is not on the table?  You might find [the post about subjective questions](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/) useful in matching your question to how the site works.
Do you remember any names at all - town, hospital name, doctor name, protagonist name? TV channel it would have been on? Do you remember whose orders the doctor was following? Just trying to jog your memory in a google-able form.
They have snazzy snazzy belts in the new movies.  Does that count?
Are you also including text-based adventures?
Could it be Dresden Codak? https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DresdenCodak
Do you actually remember any visuals in the theme song?
Which country did you watch this in? And did you watch it during its first-run or in syndication? In the United States (at least since I started watching it), first-runs on ABC didn't have it.
Do you count the prequel novellas as being included among "the books"? Because this a central plot point of "The Hedge Knight". Indeed, the title of the episode matches that of the collected novellas.

@Ongo *The MW interpretation implies that there are an infinite number of universes in which all possible realities are played out*. No, it really doesn't. All it says is that if an observer measures a quantity in a basis of states where the wave function occupies multiple states of that quantity, then the observer is themselves entangled in a mixed state. It says nothing about the extent of which wave functions will evolve in time. Also, I find it perfectly reasonable for sci fi to make up its own laws of nature. But why should we expect it to misuse existing terms?
Would the continuation of the Oz books after Baum died count?

Also, we've not seen any instance of _any_ White Walker be killed by fire, so how would you assume that?
@bracco23 Could you quote the statement please? I can't find it. If it is there, I'll be happy to check it up for you.
Don't you answer your own question? I didn't watch episode 20 but episode 19 strongly implies it is due to the use of Negative Speed Force.
Well, sure, but if blue eyed people see fine in real life, then why would you expect White Walkers to have visual issues or differences?
It was pretty wide to be honest. This isn't the real world we're talking about here. They don't have bulldozers and heavy machinery. Not did they have time. What did you expect, a 100m wide trench?
No worries @Aeg. I mean, not that your answers is incorrect either. Maybe add your's there too?
Relevant: [How much creative independence are the Show runners accorded in Game of Thrones?](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/180825/54887). We simply don't know. GRRM is known to dump hundreds of pages in the trashbin just because he doesn't like the path they take his characters on (e.g. Tyrion's arc in ADWD and TWOW). We also know GRRM changed his original intended ending with Arya and Jon hooking up at the Wall. Since GRRM isn't quite involved in the show, D&D have full independence and GRRM changes stuff as he likes, its fairly likely that Books will have a much better ending than show

Wait, the magazine had interior illustrations? You're sure about that? I think that pretty much rules out *F&SF*. Before you said that, I was thinking it sounded more line an *F&SF* story than an *Analog* story. Were you reading any *Galaxy*, *If*, *Amazing*, *Fantastic*?
Do you remember anything of the plot?
Would you accept tie-in comics to the movies? Not sure if there's ones for Spider-Man, but they do exist for stuff like Avengers: Age of Ultron.
Hm.. Are you certain this was a sci-fi / fantasy story and not a non-fiction story? Life has been rather eerily and terrifyingly imitating art far too frequently of late. Do you recall any other details of the story? Basically every hit I get involves either Daesh destroying ancient monuments in the Levant or else Americans destroying monuments in America.
Hum? _"Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, **overcome by spells**, dragging arrows from wounds"_
Why not fight with both magic and knives? The only reason wizards don’t is because they need wands to use magic.
Are you sure you shouldn't ask this on Politics instead?
I don't understand this idea that a major character *has* to have some kind of fairytale destiny and save the day. Why? "In war, people die all the time". If he had rode into King's Landing on a shining steed with Brienne fighting by his side, and slain Cersei painlessly with one hand while defending the innocent with the other non-hand, pausing only to quip a witty one-liner, the exact same people complaining about his character arc now would be (rightly) complaining about "fan service" and "plot armour".
Do you know what a rhetorical question is? That was one, and so is this.

Was it being sold as brand new or second hand? My gut feeling is that it's possibly a Japanese series based on the styling of the eyes
Do you mean "when he arrived on Earth at the end of *Infinity War*"?
Was that a single piece of fiction or was it in one of those PDFs they make available? (You can [edit] that info in your post) also - more or less when did you read it?
The diary has memories like a pensieve, which he can use to prove who was the heir of slytherin. He wasn't intending to die when he made it, or for Harry to screw things up. Does it work thinking of it as a 'save progress' in a game?
Was it animated? Live action? Do you remember the country you watched it or the network?
Is there any precedence for the King (or showrunners) directly appointing a GM - isn't that how Pycelle had his position? He was a Lannister lickspittle and not a particularly good maester
Given that both ripped off Tolkien, wouldn't it be easier to ask "how did they all get away with ripping off Tolkien so badly?"
Hi, welcome to SF&F!  You should check out the [suggestions](https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/9337/101407) for ID questions to see if it helps you recall any more details you can [edit] into your question.  For example, approximately when did you read this?
Can you describe anything about the villain (costume/main colours etc)? What was the weapon like? Do you know which Ant-Man (or spiderman for that matter) it was?
Isn't there a 'special episode' due out next week?
Do you have examples in which a random person is easily identified as from Earth, Mars, or the Belt? Belters have accents and unusually tall bodies, most of the Martians encountered are either uniformed military or high-ranking diplomats, and Earthers tend to be the stockiest.
I'm not seeing anything sci-fi / fantasy about this story (I know you mentioned that up front, but....)  - are there any details that would make it on topic for this site other than your memory of where you read it?

I find that hard to believe. What language was the story in? Was it a hardback or paperback book? What age was the "girl"? Was it a story for adults or for kids? Was the fighting described in extravangantly gory detail? How did she get into space in the first place?
Define 'girl' please...is it a pre-teen like the kids in Ender's Game? Or an early twenties? (I'm trying to suss out if it was a YA type book)
Personally, I can't follow the Question's chain of logic.  Why would they object?  At most, they scanned it a dozen different ways. She demonstrated it on a target range to the interested and curious.  Nothing to cause alarm here, carry on.  If non-standard Starfleet weapons cause alarm, then how is Worf allowed to decorate the walls of his quarters with an arsenal of blades?
I'm wondering if the show makes more sense in the original Mandarin(?). Dubbed shows tend to be incredibly loosely translated, often missing out entire concepts and themes

was it a midshipman coming to power through mutiny and then having to turn to piracy?  This made me think of a series i read where a young recruit he was frequently flogged takes power and also the captains wife and then goes on a campaign to overthrow the system
@user But Cersei didn't have a say in it? My point is though that the Faith Militant wouldn't retaliate against Margaery as that goes against who and what they are. Any retaliation would be direct against Cersei and those that helped her. Margaery wasn't a hostage after all.
While not Marvel, would someone like Superman count? He's an extraterrestrial who gets his powers by being exposed to a yellow sun. However, he's not a "transformed" superhero, that's just how the biology of Kryptonians works. Just trying to get an idea of what you're looking for.
But if that's the case, I'm not seeing how that's different from any human who gets exposed to Banner's Gamma Radiation, or Parker's radioactive spider. Virtually all humans would react the same way, right?
I’ve only seen it once, and that was weeks ago, but wasn’t it Captain Marvel?
Just checking, but you're 100% positive it was Earth?  There's another story scratching at my head that fits many of the points listed, except it *definitely* wasn't Earth; the resource they were exporting was a gland extract (and maybe the hides too) of dinosauroid native animals.
Sometimes a story doesn't need sex.  Call it "Chekov's sex scene."  Is it an integral part of the story?  Nope, leave it out.  You might ask well as why there aren't more scenes about people clipping their toenails.  You do it, I do it, does jack to advance the story so leave it out.
Is it wrong to downvote this question for not being phrased "Who's that Pokemon?"
Can you describe what this "god paradox" is that you keep referring to?
Did you see it in America?
Do you remember any particular reason the astronauts were visiting Mercury?  You mentioned that the story may have been connected with other stories about other planets. If so, was there a common theme of why the astronauts were visiting the other planets in addition to Mercury?  That kind of plot detail might help narrow things down.
Was the story of encountering these aliens being told by a character who had lost both his legs to frostbite because one of the aliens threw a rock at him and damaged his spacesuit's heating system?
Are you asking solely about the MCU or Marvel as a whole? I took the question to be about the MCU with comics referring to the supplementary comics but at present it is a bit unclear what you're referring to.
Earth's Moon, a colony of Earth, is a charter member of the UFP, as are Mars, Terra Nova and Izar. Do they count?

Do wand movements count as "more than just words"? I recall Professor Flitwick instructing students to "swish and flick" their wands in order to perform a certain spell (might have been Wingardium Leviosa, can't remember)

Did all the characters use valspeak or just one?  George Alec Effinger did a series of short stories featuring a character called [Maureen Birnbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_Birnbaum,_Barbarian_Swordsperson), one of which was originally published in *Fantasy & Science Fiction*, August 1996.
To be fair Tony invented the technology they used, what he says goes and he didn't want to lose his daughter. Think about it, would you take the flux capacitor out of the DeLorean? You're going to do what the science man wants!

Are you asking for a list of students or just the exact number?
I don't recall but perhaps you do: What was the ratio of Starfleet to Maquis personnel on the ship at the time?  Janeway was pretty strict about adhering to her ethics IIRC; if she also had the numbers it may have been a "my way or the highway" kind of agreement.
Could it be "The last book in the universe" by Philbrick? 
Why would you wear a helmet on Mars?

To clarify: Are you looking for stories that _specify_ an external-barycenter orbit of each other, or accepting stories that only implied it with "Two similar planets orbiting together and sharing an atmosphere/close enough to 'connect' in some manner"?
Which is fine, but the explanation is there in front of you. Other than us taking it in turns to agree with you that this is something of a plothole, what do you actually want to get out of this question? What would a suitable or acceptable answer look like?
The Seeker: The Dark is Rising?
The first thing I thought of was the Car in "The Last Starfighter". It has a Delorian look, that has been heavily customized. https://starcarcentral.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/starcar2.jpg But I don't know if it was actually a Delorian.

You're assuming that none of the principals knew the truth, but can we be sure of that?  Very few events in ASOIAF are reported to the world the way they actually happened; even fewer were remembered by history as they actually happened.

What canon level are you comfortable with?  Movies, Disney canon, or Legends? Edit: I guess not Legends, based on your insistence that Sith can't become Force ghosts (since Legends canon directly contradicts that).
This is actually a pretty detailed question. Congrats on that! Forgive my ignorance, but is AOT a site? Could you spell it out? And this is Ariel as in the Little Mermaid?
